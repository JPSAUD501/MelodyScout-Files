  "imageDescription": "A translucent figure fading in and out of existence, like a ghost. They're dressed in modern streetwear, holding a smartphone with a cracked screen. Their expression is a mix of sadness and annoyance. The background flickers between a brightly lit IKEA showroom and a dark, empty room. Vaporwave colors, a feeling of longing and regret.",
