  "imageDescription": "In the image, there is a dimly lit room with a large, ornate window. Outside the window, a sleek black limousine is parked, its headlights casting a soft glow. The window is slightly ajar, revealing a small figure hiding under a pillow. Shadows dance on the walls, representing the demons lurking in the darkness.",
