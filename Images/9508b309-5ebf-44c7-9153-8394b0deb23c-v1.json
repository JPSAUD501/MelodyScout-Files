  "imageDescription": "The image is of a woman standing in a dimly lit room, surrounded by shattered mirrors. Each mirror reflects a different version of herself, representing the conflicting emotions she feels towards someone she loves. The mirrors are cracked and broken, symbolizing the pain and chaos that their relationship brings. The woman's expression is a mix of anger, vulnerability, and desire, capturing the complex emotions conveyed in the song.",
