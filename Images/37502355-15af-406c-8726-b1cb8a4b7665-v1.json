  "lyrics": "I spent today winning arguments against no one in my head\nI did great, you should've been there\nThat was a joke\nSee, no one ever leaves when they're company\nThere's my audience, there's my arrogance\nThe world revolves around me (me), sleeping soundly\n\nI got home last night on a red-eye\nI'm the last one left on my good side\nYeah, I'm reflecting back\nBut I'm bad at that\nSo I'll say fuck the past and don't forget yourself\n\nIt's like that, that, that, that\nBanging in my head like bap, bap, bap, bap\nFeelings in the light go bad, bad, bad, bad\nHeadlights in my eyes go black, black, black, black\nYeah, you said it\nI'm magnetic to the things I hate the most\n\nIt's bad, bad, bad, bad\nTeasing on myself like na-na-na-na\nDriving slow, yeah, I'm losing myself\nDon't trust nobody else\nIt's 'cause, 'cause you said it\nI'm magnetic to the things I hate the most\nYeah\n\nNow I'm walking through my heart shaped door\nSinging, \"Is it me you're looking for?\"\nPink velvet on my bedroom floor\nYou're all I want and more\nBut you said it\nI'm magnetic to the things I hate the most\n\nI spent today insubordinate\nYeah, I'm fucking up, I'm recording it\nI'm projecting big through a tiny screen\nWhere I'm stacking up my reality\nYeah, I see the posts, I see the tweets\nI see his fucking face, but he's not me\nSo listen to me\n\nIt's like that, that, that, that\nBanging in my head like bap, bap, bap, bap\nFeelings in the light go bad, bad, bad, bad\nHeadlights in my eyes go black, black, black, black\nYeah, you said it\nI'm magnetic to the things I hate the most\n\nIt's bad, bad, bad, bad\nTeasing on myself like na-na-na-na\nDriving slow, yeah, I'm losing myself\nDon't trust nobody else\nIt's 'cause, 'cause you said it\nI'm magnetic to the things I hate the most\n\nNow I'm walking through my star-shaped morgue\nSinging, \"What the fuck I do it for?\"\nHeard voices from my closet door\n\"You're all we want and more\"\nYeah, you said it\nI'm magnetic to the things I hate the most",
