  "imageDescription": "A young couple lays in the bed of a classic Chevy pickup truck, parked on a dirt road overlooking a moonlit valley.  The truck's engine glows warm orange against the cool blue night, stars dotting the vast sky above.  A sense of freedom and intimacy fills the air, painted in a style that's both nostalgic and achingly romantic.",
