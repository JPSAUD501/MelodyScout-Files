  "lyrics": "Hit you up, late at night\nAll I wanna is to get high\nFeel the wind in my hair\nI need to feel alive\n\nUp all night by your side\nI'm not preoccupied\nThrough the dark, feel so good\nNow over me and you\n\nAnd I want you in the summer light\nAnd I need you 'til the sun goes down\nI'll be with you in my paradise\n'Cause I need you 'til the sun goes down\n\nAnd I want you in the summer light\nAnd I need you 'til the sun goes down\nI'll be with you in my paradise\n'Cause I need you 'til the sun goes down\n\nHold me close, feel my fire\nA heartbeat synced all night\nFeel the tides in my life\nKiss me once, I'll kiss you twice\n\nUp all night by your side, I'm not preoccupied\nThrough the dark, feel so good\nNow over me and you\n\nAnd I want you in the summer light\nAnd I need you 'til the sun goes down\nI'll be with you in my paradise\n'Cause I need you 'til the sun goes down\n\nAnd I want you in the summer light\nAnd I need you 'til the sun goes down\nI'll be with you in my paradise\n'Cause I need you 'til the sun goes down",
  "imageDescription": "A couple kissing passionately in a field of flowers under a setting sun. The sky is ablaze with color, and the air is filled with the sound of crickets chirping.",
