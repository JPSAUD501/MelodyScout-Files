  "lyrics": "Are you insane like me?\nBeen in pain like me?\nBought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?\nJust to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?\nWould you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?\n\nAre you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?\nDo you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?\nDo the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?\nSaying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?\n\nAnd all the people say\nYou can't wake up, this is not a dream\nYou're part of a machine, you are not a human being\nWith your face all made up, living on a screen\nLow on self-esteem, so you run on gasoline\n\nI think there's a flaw in my code\n(Oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, oh)\nThese voices won't leave me alone\nWell, my heart is gold and my hands are cold\n\nAre you deranged like me?\nAre you strange like me?\nLighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?\nDo you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?\nPointing fingers 'cause you'll never take the blame like me?\n\nAnd all the people say\nYou can't wake up, this is not a dream\nYou're part of a machine, you are not a human being\nWith your face all made up, living on a screen\nLow on self-esteem, so you run on gasoline\n\nI think there's a flaw in my code\n(Oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, oh)\nThese voices won't leave me alone\nWell, my heart is gold and my hands are cold",
  "imageDescription": "A glitch in a computer system. Binary code scrolls down the screen, and the words \"flaw in my code\" appear in large, red letters. The screen flickers and distorts, and the words \"voices won't leave me alone\" appear. The screen then goes black, and the words \"my heart is gold and my hands are cold\" appear in white letters.",
