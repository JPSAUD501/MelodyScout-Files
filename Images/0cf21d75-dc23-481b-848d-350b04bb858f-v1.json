  "lyrics": "It's you and your world\nAnd I'm caught in the middle\nI caught the edge of a knife\nAnd it hurts just a little\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know\nAnd I know that I can't be your friend\nIt's my head or my heart\nAnd I'm caught in the middle\n\nMy hands are tied, but not tight enough\nYou're the high that I can't give up\nOh lord, here we go\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\nAt the bottom of a bottle\nYou're the poison in the wine\nAnd I know\nI can't change you, and I\nI won't change\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\n\nEyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (Oh)\nBefore the rush to my blood\nWas too much and we flatlined (Oh)\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know\nAnd I know just how this ends\nNow I'm all messed up\nAnd it feels like the first time (Oh)\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\nAt the bottom of a bottle\nYou're the poison in the wine\nAnd I know\nI can't change you, and I\nI won't change\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\n\nMy hands are tied, but not tight enough\nYou're the high that I can't give up\nOh lord, here we go\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\nAt the bottom of a bottle\nYou're the poison in the wine\nAnd I know\nI can't change you, and I\nI won't change\nI might hate myself tomorrow\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nLet's be lonely together\nA little less lonely together\nLet's be lonely together\n(Let's be lonely lonely now)\n(Let's be lonely lonely now)\n\nA little less lonely together\nA little less lonely now\nA little less lonely now\nA little less lonely now",
