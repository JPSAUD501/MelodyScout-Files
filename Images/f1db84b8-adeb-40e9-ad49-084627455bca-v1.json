  "lyrics": "All the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nI let it fall, my heart\nAnd as it fell, you rose to claim it\nIt was dark and I was over\nUntil you kissed my lips and you saved me\n\nMy hands, they're strong\nBut my knees were far too weak\nTo stand in your arms\nWithout falling to your feet\n\nBut there's a side to you\nThat I never knew, never knew\nAll the things you'd say\nThey were never true, never true\nAnd the games you play\nYou would always win, always win\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nBut I set fire\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say",
  "imageDescription": "A watercolor painting of a woman with her head bowed and her hands covering her face. She is standing in the rain, which is on fire. The flames are licking at her skin, but she seems not to notice. Her eyes are closed and her expression is one of pain and despair.",
