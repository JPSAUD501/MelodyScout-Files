  "lyrics": "Time slows down when it can get no worse\nI can feel it running out on me\nI don't want these to be my last words\nAll forgotten 'cause that's all they'll be\n\nNow there's only one thing I can do\nFight until the end like I promised to\nWishing there was something left to lose\nThis could be the day I die for you\n\nWhat do you see before it's over?\nBlinding flashes getting closer\nWish that I had something left to lose\nThis could be the day I die for you\nThis could be the day I die for you\n\nThis could be the day I die for you\nThis could be the day\n\nEverything I know, everything I hold tight\nWhen to let it go, when to make 'em all fight\nWhen I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind\nWhen I gotta live, when I gotta die, gotta die\nEverything I know, everything I hold tight\nWhen to let it go, when to make 'em all fight\nWhen I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind\nWhen I gotta live, when I gotta die\n\nThis could be the day I die for you\nEverything I know, everything I hold tight\nWhen to let it go, when to make 'em all fight\nWhen I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind (this could be the day)\nWhen I gotta live, when I gotta die\n\nFeeling like there's nothing I can do\nThis could be the end it's mine to choose\nIt's taken me my lifetime just to prove\nThis could be the day I die for you\nDon't let it be the day\n\nWhat do you see before it's over?\nBlinding flashes getting closer\nSacrificing everything I knew\nThis could be the day I die for you\n\nThis could be the day I die for you\nEverything I know, everything I hold tight\nWhen to let it go, when to make 'em all fight\nWhen I'm in control, when I'm out of my mind (don't let it be the day)\nWhen I gotta live, when I gotta die",
