  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWake up in the morning feeling like Nick Jonas (Oh my gosh!)\nI got my pixie sticks and hairbrush, this happens every day\nI'm really lazy, all I do\nIt's sit and eat this cheese stick, my pants are on the ground\nI think I'm going crazy\n\n[PreChorus]\nTalking Aunt Jemima on my toes, toes\nPeter Griffin on my clothes, clothes\nChopsticks all up in my nose, nose\n(Ouch, it's that blood?)\nTaking my MySpace pic in the bathroom\nEating all of these pinchees\nTurning into a hobo\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's punch Cap'n Crunch\nThen we'll eat his face for lunch\nFly a kite, drink some Sprite\nTill we go to sleep tonight, tick tock\nFound a rock, gonna knock this poser's socks off\nWoah, they're purple\nWoah, woah\nLet's punch Cap'n Crunch\nThen we'll eat his face for lunch\nFly a kite\nDrink Some Sprite\nTill we go to sleep tonight\nTick Tock\nFound a rock\nGonna knock this poser's socks off\nWoah they're purple\nWoah, woah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI just ordered a pizza\nAs well as 46 others\nCause my fridge was out of milk\nSo I talked about its mother\nAnd my friends are lining up\nBecause they're waiting for their meal\nI just opened up my toilet seat to Shaquille O'Neill\n\n[PreChorus]\nI got mad so I punched my van, van\nI'm turning into a man, man\nI started my very own clan, clan\nChew gum and stick it on a tree, tree\nJust kidding, that could kill a bee, bee\nGoing on a killing spree\nI shot my knee\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's punch Cap'n Crunch\nThen we'll eat his face for lunch\nFly a kite\nDrink Some Sprite\nTill we go to sleep tonight\nTick Tock\nFound a rock\nGonna knock this poser's socks off\nWoah they're purple\nWoah, woah\nLet's punch Cap'n Crunch\nThen we'll eat his face for lunch\nFly a kite\nDrink Some Sprite\nTill we go to sleep tonight\nTick Tock\nFound a rock\nGonna knock this poser's socks off\nWoah they're purple\nWoah, woah\n\n[Bridge]\nMy car smelled really bad\nSo I wore some plaid\nI bought myself an air freshener\nIt's called Peachy Peach\nBut it smelled like an elf\nSo I threw it out\nAnd tweeted all about it\nMy car smelled really bad\nSo I wore some plaid\nI bought myself an air freshener\nIt's called Peachy Peach\nBut it smelled like an elf\nSo I threw it out\nAnd tweeted all about it\n\nNow I just restocked the fridge\nI bought 1 percent\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's punch Cap'n Crunch\nThen we'll eat his face for lunch\nFly a kite\nDrink Some Sprite\nTill we go to sleep tonight\nTick Tock\nFound a rock\nGonna knock this poser's socks off\nWoah they're purple\nWoah, woah\nLet's punch Cap'n Crunch\nThen we'll eat his face for lunch\nFly a kite\nDrink Some Sprite\nTill we go to sleep tonight\nTick Tock\nFound a rock\nGonna knock this poser's socks off\nWoah they're purple\nWoah, woah",

The collage captures the playful and nonsensical nature of the song's lyrics.",
