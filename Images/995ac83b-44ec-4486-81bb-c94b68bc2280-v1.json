  "imageDescription": "The image is a simple photograph of a person sitting alone on a couch, looking out the window with a sad expression on their face. The room is dimly lit, and there are empty bottles scattered around, symbolizing the feeling of being trapped and depressed. The person's blonde hair contrasts with the somber atmosphere, representing the loss of fun and the longing for a more carefree time.",
