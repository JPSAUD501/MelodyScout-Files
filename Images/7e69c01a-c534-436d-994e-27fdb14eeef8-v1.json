  "lyrics": "Moon, a hole of light\nThrough the big top tent up high\nHere before and after me\nShinin' down on me\nMoon, tell me if I could\nSend up my heart to you?\nSo, when I die, which I must do\nCould it shine down here with you?\n\n'Cause my love is mine, all mine\nI love mine, mine, mine\nNothing in the world belongs to me\nBut my love mine, all mine, all mine\n\nMy baby, here on earth\nShowed me what my heart was worth\nSo, when it comes to be my turn\nCould you shine it down here for her?\n\n'Cause my love is mine, all mine\nI love mine, mine, mine\nNothing in the world belongs to me\nBut my love mine, all mine\nNothing in the world is mine for free\nBut my love mine, all mine, all mine",
  "imageDescription": "The image is of a full moon shining brightly in the night sky, surrounded by a circus tent. Inside the tent, a tightrope walker gracefully balances on a thin wire, representing the delicate balance of love and the fleeting nature of life. The moon's light illuminates the scene, symbolizing the eternal connection between two souls.",
