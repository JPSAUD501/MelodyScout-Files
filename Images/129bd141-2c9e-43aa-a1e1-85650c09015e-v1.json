  "imageDescription": "A lone figure stands in a desolate wasteland, surrounded by darkness. The figure is dressed in all black, their face hidden. In front of them lies a barren tree, its branches twisted and lifeless. The image symbolizes emptiness and despair, capturing the essence of the song's lyrics and the feeling of being trapped in a bleak existence.",
