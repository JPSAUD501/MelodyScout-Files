  "lyrics": "Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you\nI drink too much and that′s an issue, but I'm okay\nHey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them\n\nBut I hope I never see them again\n\nI know it breaks your heart\nMoved to the city in a broke-down car, and\nFour years, no calls\nNow you′re looking pretty in a hotel bar\nAnd I-I-I can't stop\nNo, I-I-I can't stop\n\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can′t afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf that mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain′t ever getting older\n\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\nWe ain′t ever getting older\n\nYou, look as good as the day I met you\nI forget just why I left you, I was insane\nStay and play that Blink-182 song\nThat we beat to death in Tucson, okay\n\nI know it breaks your heart\nMoved to the city in a broke-down car, and\nFour years, no call\nNow I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar\nAnd I-I-I can′t stop\nNo, I-I-I can't stop\n\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can′t afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf that mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\nWe ain′t ever getting older\n\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can′t afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf that mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\nWe ain′t ever getting older\nNo, we ain't ever getting older\nWe ain′t ever getting older\nNo, we ain't ever getting older\nWe ain′t ever getting older\nWe ain't ever getting older\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\nNo, we ain′t ever getting older\n\nWe ain′t ever getting older\n\nNo, we ain't ever getting older",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song is a couple sitting in the backseat of a car, with the city lights glowing outside the window. The girl has a tattoo on her shoulder and is biting it playfully, while the guy is pulling the sheets off the corner of a bed. The image captures the youthful, carefree spirit of the song.",
