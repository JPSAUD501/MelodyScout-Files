  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nUnder the knife I surrendered\nThe innocence yours to consume\nYou cut it away\nAnd you filled me up with hate\nInto the silence you sent me\nInto the fire consumed\nYou thought I’d forget\nBut it’s always in my head\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the pulse in my veins\nYou're the war that I wage\nCan you change me?\nCan you change me?\nYou're the love that I hate\nYou're the drug that I take\nWill you cage me?\nWill you cage me?\nYou're the pulse in my veins\nYou're the war that I wage\nCan you change me?\nCan you change me?\nFrom the monster you made me?\nFrom the monster you made me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is the world you've created\nThe product of what I've become\nMy soul and my youth\nSeems it's all for you to use\nIf I could take back the moment\nI'll let you get under my skin\nRelent or resist?\nSeems the monster always wins\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the pulse in my veins\nYou're the war that I wage\nCan you change me?\nCan you change me?\nYou're the love that I hate\nYou're the drug that I take\nWill you cage me?\nWill you cage me?\nYou're the pulse in my veins\nYou're the war that I wage\nCan you change me?\nCan you change me?\nFrom the monster you made me?\nFrom the monster you made me?\n\n[Bridge]\nMy heart's an artifice, a decoy soul\nI'll lift you up and then I'll let you go\nI've made an art of digging shallow holes\nI drop the darkness in and watch it grow\nMy heart's an artifice, a decoy soul\nWho knew the emptiness could be so cold?\nI've lost the parts of me that make me whole\nI am the darkness, I'm a monster\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the pulse in my veins\nYou're the war that I wage\nCan you change me?\nCan you change me?\nYou're the love that I hate\nYou're the drug that I take\nWill you cage me?\nWill you cage me?\nYou're the pulse in my veins\nYou're the war that I wage\nCan you change me?\nCan you change me?\nFrom the monster you made me?\nFrom the monster you made me?\nFrom the monster you made me?\nFrom the monster you made me?",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song is a shattered mirror reflecting a distorted, monstrous version of oneself. The fragmented pieces symbolize the brokenness and loss of innocence, while the distorted reflection represents the internal struggle and transformation caused by external influences. The image captures the theme of being consumed by hate and the constant battle within oneself.",
