  "imageDescription": "A woman with wild, colorful Einstein hair stands confidently against a backdrop of mathematical equations swirling in vibrant hues. Lab beakers bubble over with love potions, chalkboards are scrawled with hearts and formulas, and gears turn in sync with a beating heart. The style is surreal, whimsical, and bursting with chaotic love.",
