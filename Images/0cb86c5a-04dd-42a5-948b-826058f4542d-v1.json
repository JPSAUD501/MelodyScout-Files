Oh!\n\nOff, off with your head\nDance, dance til you're dead (dead)\nHeads will roll\nHeads will roll\nHeads will roll\nOn the floor\n\nLooking glass\nTake the past\nShut your eyes\nRealize\n\nLooking glass\nTake the past\nShut your eyes\nRealize\n\nGlitter on the wet streets\nSilver over everything\nThe river's all wet\nYou're all chrome\nYou're all chrome\nOh!\nOh oh!\n\nOff, off, off with your head\nDance, dance dance til you're dead\nOff, off, off with your head\nDance, dance, dance til you're dead\nOff, off, off with your head\nDance, dance, dance til you're dead\nOff, off, off with your head\nDance, dance, dance til you're dead\nOff, off, off with your head\nDance, dance, dance til you're dead\nOff, off, off with your head\nDance, dance, dance til you're dead",
  "imageDescription": "A dark and surreal scene of a dance floor bathed in silver light. The floor is covered in a layer of glitter and blood, and the walls are lined with mirrors. In the center of the room, a group of people dance wildly, their bodies contorting in unnatural ways. Their heads are all missing, and their wounds are still fresh. The air is filled with the sound of their screams and the music.",
