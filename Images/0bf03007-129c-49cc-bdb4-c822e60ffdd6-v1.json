  "imageDescription": "A cracked cigarette burning on a saucer, surrounded by a pile of white powder. A man lies on a messy bed with a new girl beside him, while his old girl sleeps at home. In the background, a designer Dior bag sits open, filled with drugs. The image captures the song's themes of addiction, infidelity, and materialism.",
