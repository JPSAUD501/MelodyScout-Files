(Yeah)\n\nYou'd be paranoid too\nIf everyone you knew\nWas out to get you\nYou'd be paranoid too\nIf everyone you knew\nWas out to get you\n\nMight just rent a hotel room\nLight a couple candles\nFind out that I'm cancelled (shit)\nBut I bought a bunch of candy\nAs much as they would give me at the CVS\nMy plan B\n\nI might just lose my shit off of the balcony, room 103\nYeah, that's my purgatory\nUntil I end it all (shit)\nWhoops, I got a little dark\nYeah, things get a little hard\n\nWhen you've got eyes in my closet\nHands in my pockets\n\nYou'd be paranoid too\nIf everyone you knew\nWas out to get you\nYou'd be paranoid too\nIf everyone you knew\nWas out to get you\n\nHave Britney moment, had to cut it off\nI got what I wanted\nOr at least I thought\nYeah, I'm a little bit of a little bitch, so?\nI might turn around and say some stupid shit, no\nHad to have my Britney moment, and I cut it off (cut it off)\n\nYou'd be paranoid too\nIf everyone you knew\nWas out to get you\nYou'd be paranoid too\nIf everyone you knew\nWas out to get you\n(If everyone was out to get you)\n\nI'm a little bit of a little bitch, so?\nI might turn around and say some stupid shit (no)\nI'm a little bit of a little bitch, so?\nI might turn around and say some stupid shit (no)",
  "imageDescription": "Description: A person stands alone in a dimly lit room, surrounded by multiple pairs of eyes peeking out from the darkness of a closet. The person's hands are nervously tucked in their pockets as they glance around, feeling a sense of paranoia and isolation. The image captures the inner turmoil and vulnerability expressed in the lyrics of the song.",
