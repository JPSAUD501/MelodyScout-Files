  "lyrics": "Some people are a lot like clouds, you know\n'Cause life's so much brighter when they go\nYou rained on my heart for far too long\nCouldn't see the thunder for the storm\n\nBecause I cut my teeth and bit my tongue\n'Til my mouth was dripping blood\nBut I never dished the dirt, just held my breath\nWhile you dragged me through the mud\nI don't know why I tried to save you 'cause\nI can't save you from yourself\nWhen all you give a shit about is everybody else\n\nAnd you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?\nI think it's time to stop\n\nYou need a taste of your own medicine\n'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing\nWatch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you\nAct like nothing's real like you\nSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit\n\nSome people are a lot like clouds, you know\n'Cause life's so much brighter when they go\nAnd I spent too long in a place I don't belong\nI couldn't see the thunder for the storm\n\nBut you won't admit, why don't you get a grip?\n'Cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like this\nAnd you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?\nI think it's time to stop\n\nYou need a taste of your own medicine\n'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing\nWatch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you\nAct like nothing's real like you\nSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit\n\n'Cause I cut my teeth and bit my tongue\n'Til my mouth was dripping blood\nBut I never dished the dirt, just held my breath\nWhile you dragged me through the mud\nYeah, I cut my teeth and bit my tongue\n'Til my mouth was dripping blood\nBut I never dished the dirt, just held my breath\nWhile you dragged me through the mud\n\nAnd you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?\nI think it's time to stop\n\nYou need a taste of your own medicine\n'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing\nWatch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you\nAct like nothing's real like you\nSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit\n\nTaste of your own medicine\nYeah, I'm sick to death of swallowing\nWatch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you\nAct like nothing's real like you\nSo I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit\n\nSome people are a lot like clouds, you know\n'Cause life's so much brighter when they go",
