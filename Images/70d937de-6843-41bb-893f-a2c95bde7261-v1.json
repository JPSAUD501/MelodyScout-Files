  "imageDescription": "The image is a cracked mirror reflecting a person's shattered reflection. The cracks represent the pain and brokenness expressed in the song's lyrics. The mirror symbolizes the struggle of trying to see oneself clearly amidst a toxic relationship, where both parties are broken and unable to heal each other.",
