  "lyrics": "Call me a thief\nThere's been a robbery\nI left with her heart\nTore it apart\nMade no apologies\n\nI've been living in the darkness\nShadows in my apartment, heartless\nTaking love just to spill it on parchment\nNext page and I'm out again\nI've been living in the night life\nLips hit you like a drive by, frost bite\nIce cold, I mean they cut you like a sharp knife\nNext page and I'm out again\n\nSkin on my skin, what a wonderful sin\nTake your breath but you're asking for more\nThe tip of my finger is tracing your figure\nI say good night and walk out the door\n\nCall me a thief\nThere's been a robbery\nI left with her heart\nTore it apart\nMade no apologies\nJust call me a thief\nShe was on top of me\nThen I left with her heart\nBroken and scarred\nMade no apologies\n\nWe can be so hollow\nLike my rib cage, the echoes follow\nFollow me like the fears I swallow\nAnd drown in all my mistakes\nAll I know is if my skin bled\nLike the ink dripped from my pen\nMy bed will be drenched in a scarlet rose red\nAnd drown in all my mistakes\n\nSkin on my skin, what a wonderful sin\nTake your breath but you're asking for more\nThe tip of my finger is tracing your figure\nI say good night and walk out the door\n\nCall me a thief\nThere's been a robbery\nI left with her heart\nTore it apart\nMade no apologies\nJust call me a thief\nShe was on top of me\nThen I left with her heart\nBroken and scarred\nMade no apologies\n\nGirl you better just lock me up\nBecause I've never been good for nothing\nSo you better just lock me up, lock me up\nGirl you better just lock me up\nBecause I've never been good for nothing\nSo you better just lock me up, lock me up\n\nThe tip of my finger is tracing your figure\nI say good night and walk out the door\n\nCall me a thief\nThere's been a robbery\nI left with her heart\nTore it apart\nMade no apologies\nJust call me a thief\nShe was on top of me\nThen I left with her heart\nBroken and scarred\nMade no apologies\n\nGirl you better just lock me up\nBecause I've never been good for nothing\nSo you better just lock me up, lock me up\nGirl you better just lock me up\nBecause I've never been good for nothing\nSo you better just lock me up, lock me up",
  "imageDescription": "In the image, a shadowy figure stands in front of a dimly lit room. The figure holds a heart, torn and broken, in their hand. The heart is dripping ink, symbolizing the spilled emotions and pain caused. The room is filled with scattered pieces of paper, representing the pages of a story that was written and discarded. The image captures the essence of theft and heartbreak, conveying the haunting and remorseless nature of the song.",
