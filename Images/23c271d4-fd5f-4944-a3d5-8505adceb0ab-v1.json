  "lyrics": "This is the last day of my life, yours too\nHaven't you ever seen the ocean look so blue?\nAnd if we're running out of time\nShe said, \"All of the children are so anxious, they're on edge\"\nThe air is tense, so tense\n\nMoral panic is setting in\nTerror fever, it's too late to begin\nYour excuses are wearing thin\nMoral panic, it's too late to begin\nMoral panic is setting in\nTerror fever, it's too late to begin\nYour excuses are wearing thin\nMoral panic, it's too late to begin\n\nThis is the last day of my life, yours too\nBetter be ready 'cause it's coming to find you\nOh then don't call it a lie, it's false truth\nAnd the blackest sky is falling over you\nAnd it's soon, so soon\n\nMoral panic is setting in\nTerror fever, it's too late to begin\nYour excuses are wearing thin\nMoral panic, it's too late to begin\nIt's too late to begin\n\nNow, the earth, it turns so slow\nStrike up a match and we let it go\nNow, the earth, it burns so slow\nA million faces in a row\nStanding back and we watch it go\nAnd we let it go\nAnd we let it go\nAnd we let it\n\nMoral panic is setting in\nTerror fever, it's too late to begin\nYour excuses are wearing thin\nMoral panic, it's too late to begin\n\nNow, the earth, it burns so slow\nA million faces in a row\nStanding back and we watch it go\nAnd we let it go\nAnd we let it\n\nEvery moment, we let it go\nEvery moment, we let it go\nInformation age is the modern joke\nEvery moment, we let it go",
