  "imageDescription": "An image of a couple lying on a bed, with the man wearing only a white t-shirt and the woman in a state of undress, representing the intimacy and vulnerability of the song. The room is dimly lit, creating a sensual atmosphere, and there is a faint glow from the sunset outside the window, symbolizing the passage of time.",
