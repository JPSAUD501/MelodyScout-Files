  "lyrics": "Maybe it's the way you say my name\nMaybe it's the way you play your game\nBut it's so good, I've never known anybody like you\nBut it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you\n\nAnd I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime\nAnd I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine\n\n'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine\nAnd I see forever in your eyes\nI feel okay when I see you smile, smile\n\nWishing on dandelions all of the time\nPraying to God that one day you'll be mine\nWishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time\n\nI think that you are the one for me\n'Cause it gets so hard to breathe\nWhen you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free\nWhen you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy\n\nAnd I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime\nAnd I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine\n\n'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine\nAnd I see forever in your eyes\nI feel okay when I see you smile, smile\n\nWishing on dandelions all of the time\nPraying to God that one day you'll be mine\nWishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time\n\nDandelion, into the wind you go\nWon't you let my darling know?\nDandelion, into the wind you go\nWon't you let my darling know that?\n\nI'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine\nAnd I see forever in your eyes\nI feel okay when I see you smile, smile\n\nWishing on dandelions all of the time\nPraying to God that one day you'll be mine\nWishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time\n\nI'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine",
  "imageDescription": "A young woman lies in a field of dandelions, sunlight dappling through the fluffy seeds. She holds a dandelion clock, sending wishes into the wind. Her expression is hopeful, longing, with a soft, dreamy smile. Romantic, ethereal style with a warm, golden light.",
