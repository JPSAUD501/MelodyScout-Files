  "lyrics": "When I fall asleep at night\nI wish my brain could sneak away\nIncrease my pace and hop the gate\nAnd travel to another plane\nFirst I'd find my evil twin\nThen I will make best friends with it\nWe'd both hate the same things\nAnd waste some hours talking shit\nWe could write some songs\nJoel would be impressed\nWe complete each other's lines\nBecause our stupid brains connect\nBut because that our serotonin would crash\nAt approximately the same time\nAnd we both would need a nap\nGoddamn\n\nSunbathe\nLooking like a Sunday\nWishing for a someday\nI could run away like that\nNow I think I need a life or maybe nine\n'Cause I feel like I'm running out of time, yea\nSomeday maybe on a Sunday\nI can sit and sunbathe\nI could run away like that\nNow I think I need a life or maybe nine\n'Cause I'm feeling like I'm running out of time, oh oh\n\nI've seen a place I'd like to stay\nNirvana, but it's far away\nYeah, it might take a couple planes\nAnd parachutes for my escape\nJump face-first into the sun\nWe've got the same sunglasses on\nMy solar eyes grow polarized\nBut the blinding light is so much fun\nYeah, maybe paradise\nIs somewhere deep inside\nThe halls or walls\nWhere I've spent all my time\nBuilding my whole life\nWhere I feel alright\n'Cause I never wanna leave the secret life of me\nThe secret life of me\n\nSunbathe\nLooking like a Sunday\nWishing for a someday\nI could run away like that\nNow I think I need a life or maybe nine\n'Cause I feel like I'm running out of time, yea\nSomeday maybe on a Sunday\nI can sit and sunbathe\nI could run away like that\nNow I think I need a life or maybe nine\n'Cause I'm feeling like I'm running out of time, oh, oh\n\nI feel like I'm running out of time\nReal life never feels like it's mine\nSo I'll dissociate until I'm fine\nUntil I'm fine\nI keep my eyes wide shut\nLive a secret life for fun\nAway from anyone and everyone\n\nAnd someday I will Sunbathe\nLooking like a Sunday\nWishing for a someday\nI could run away like that\nNow I think I need a life or maybe nine\n'Cause I feel like I'm running out of time, yea (feels like I'm running out of time)\nSomeday maybe on a Sunday\nI can sit and sunbathe\nI could run away like that (away like that)\nNow I think I need a life or maybe nine\n'Cause I'm feeling like I'm running out of time, oh, oh",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song \"Sunbathe\" is a person lying on a sandy beach, basking in the warm sunlight. They have their eyes closed, a blissful expression on their face, and are completely relaxed. The beach is empty and peaceful, creating a sense of escape and freedom.",
