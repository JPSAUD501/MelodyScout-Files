  "lyrics": "Parading to the masses, we're coming so fresh to death\nI've been stealing looks from shadows you conjure with your purse\nYeah, you're walking in stilettos, but your nose is bleeding out\nI've been running from the devil, but the devil's on my back\nI'm decreasing, took a leave of absence from the war\nIf the wall is coming down, then we gotta press the pedal\nGot my hands up in the air, I'm saying I can't breathe\nI got my hands up in the air, I'm saying\n\nHey, man, get away from me\nYeah, hey, man, get away from me\noh yeah\n\nNever ask for any favours, nothing I want from you\nI've been looking for an answer to keep me from falling through\nBut I'm waiting for the voice to speak, 'cause I can't see\nI hope we'll hear the sound eventually\n\nI felt their claws obstruct and refuse refugees in the new Rome\nLock our voices in the oven like s-Sylvia at home\nMy eyes are on the world, and my hands anxious to feel something real\nTrue colours tend to glisten and then reveal\n\nWhere's the love?\nAnd why are we so far from love?\n\nChased by badges, ducking lights\nPush the dagger when it's right\nMartial law, inshallah, mi casa es tuya\nGhosting like I'm Daniel Johnston, and I'm locked up in the basement\nWhere Satan lies in satin tweets and realigns his facelift\nThe criminals are laughing with their empty, toothless faces\nWe melted all our gold to recommence our idol worship\nWe all pretend one day we'll be the greatest of the Gatsbys\nGrowling mouths with rabies and loyal like Sid and Nancy\n\nHey, man, get away from me\nYou pretend you got control\nHey, man, get away from me\n\nI never asked for any favours, nothing I want from you\nWell, I've been praying for an answer to keep me from falling through\nYeah, I'm waiting for the voice to speak, 'cause I can't see\nOh, we'll hear the sound eventually\nWe'll hear the sound, we'll hear the sound eventually",
