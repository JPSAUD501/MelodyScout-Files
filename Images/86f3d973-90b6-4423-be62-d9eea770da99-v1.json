  "lyrics": "How can you see into my eyes like open doors?\nLeading you down into my core \nWhere I've become so numb\nWithout a soul\nMy spirit's sleeping somewhere cold \nUntil you find it there and lead it back home\n\nWake me up inside (save me)\nCall my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)\nBid my blood to run (I can't wake up)\nBefore I come undone (save me)\nSave me from the nothing I've become\n\nNow that I know what I'm without\nYou can't just leave me \nBreathe into me and make me real\nBring (bring) me (me) to life\n\nWake me up inside (save me)\nCall my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)\nBid my blood to run (I can't wake up)\nBefore I come undone (save me)\nSave me from the nothing I've become\n\nBring me to life\nI've been living a lie\nThere's nothing inside\nBring me to life\n\nFrozen (frozen) inside without your touch\nWithout your love, darling\nOnly (only) you are the life among the dead\n\nAll of this time, I can't believe I couldn't see\nKept in the dark, but you were there in front of me\nI've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems\nGot to open my eyes to everything\nWithout a thought, without a voice, without a soul \nDon't let me die here\n(There must be something more) bring me to life\n\nWake me up inside (save me)\nCall my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)\nBid my blood to run (I can't wake up)\nBefore I come undone (save me)\nSave me from the nothing I've become\n\nBring me to life\nI've been living a lie\nThere's nothing inside\nBring me to life",
  "imageDescription": "The image is of a person lying on the ground, their body turned to stone, representing their numbness and lack of soul. Above them, a vibrant, glowing figure reaches down, their hand outstretched, symbolizing someone who has the power to awaken and save them from their darkness. The contrast between the lifeless figure and the vibrant figure represents the transformation that occurs when they are brought back to life.",
