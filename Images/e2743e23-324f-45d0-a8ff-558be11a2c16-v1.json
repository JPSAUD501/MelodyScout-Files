  "imageDescription": "A lone figure stands defiantly in the middle of a dusty road. They are dressed in tattered clothes and have a determined expression on their face. The wind whips around them, blowing their hair and clothes. In the distance, a large group of people can be seen approaching. The figure stands their ground, ready to face whatever comes their way.",
