  "lyrics": "I dream of the touching the sky, I hear it calling\nI keep my eyes open wide, I see it coming\nI feel like catching a vibe, it's the summertime\nI feel like taking a ride, and leave it all behind\n\nI see the light is fading\nWhy don't we chase the morning sun\n'Cause what's the point of waiting\nI know the best is yet to come\n\nOne day we'll remember these moments\n'Cause right here\nThese are the golden years\nRight now, let's just live in the moment\n'Cause we won't live forever\nSo let's just stay forever right here\n\nWe won't live forever\nSo let's just stay forever right here\nWe won't live forever\nSo let's just stay forever right here\n\nWhen we were younger, we wanted to fly away\nTo infinite summers, I'm wondering why we waited\nSo long to do what we want, 'cause now it's \"C'est la vie\"\nI know nothing could go wrong when you are here with me\n\nI see the light is fading\nWhy don't we chase the morning sun\n'Cause what's the point of waiting\nI know the best is yet to come\n\nOne day we'll remember these moments\n'Cause right here\nThese are the golden years\nRight now, let's just live in the moment\n'Cause we won't live forever\nSo let's just stay forever right here\n\nWe won't live forever\nSo let's just stay forever right here\nWe won't live forever\nSo let's just stay forever right here",
  "imageDescription": "A carefree group of friends laughing and running through a golden field, bathed in warm sunlight. The sky above is a brilliant blue, with a few fluffy white clouds dotting the horizon. The air is filled with the sound of their laughter and the gentle breeze rustling through the grass.",
