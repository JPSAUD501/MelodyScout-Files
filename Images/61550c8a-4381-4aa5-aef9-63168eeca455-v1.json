(Ah-ah)\nI need something that'll make me believe (ah-ah)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nIf you're good enough, you'll find a way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change (her ways)\nDo you think about it night and day?\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n\nOh-oh\nOoh\n\nI come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me (ooh)\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nHoudini\nCatch me or I go Houdini",
  "imageDescription": "The image is of a woman standing in a spotlight, her body partially disappearing into thin air like a magician's trick. She holds a deck of cards in her hand, with some cards floating around her. The background is filled with colorful bursts of light, symbolizing the fleeting nature of her presence. It captures the essence of the song's theme of coming and going, like a Houdini.",
