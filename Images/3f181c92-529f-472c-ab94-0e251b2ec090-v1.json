  "lyrics": "Down by the river by the boat\nWhere everybody goes to be alone\nWhere you won′t see any rising sun\n\nDown to the river we will run\n\nWhen by the water we drink to the dregs\nLook at the stones on the riverbed\nI can tell from your eyes\nYou've never been by the riverside\n\nDown by the water, the riverbed\nSomebody calls you, somebody says\n\"Swim with the current and float away\"\nDown by the river everyday\n\nOh my God\nI see how everything is torn in the river deep\nAnd I don′t know why I go the way\nDown by the riverside\n\nWhen that old river runs past your eyes\nTo wash off the dirt on the riverside\nGo to the water so very near\nThe river will be your eyes and ears\n\nI walk to the borders on my own\nFall in the water just like a stone\nChilled to the marrow in them bones\nWhy do I go here all alone?\n\nOh my God\nI see how everything is torn in the river deep\nAnd I don't know why I go the way\nDown by the riverside\n\nOh my God\nI see how everything is torn in the river deep\nAnd I don't know why I go the way\nDown by the riverside\n\nOh, oh, I\nOh, oh, I\nOh, oh, I\nDown by the riverside\nDown by the riverside",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song is a serene river with a lone boat floating on the calm water. The sun has just set, casting a warm orange glow on the riverbed, where smooth stones can be seen. The image captures the feeling of solitude and reflection, as well as the sense of being one with nature.",
