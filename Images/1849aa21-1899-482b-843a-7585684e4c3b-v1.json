(ah-ah-ha)\nI need something that′ll make me believe (ah-ah-ha)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go, Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I′m not here for long)\nCatch me or I go, Houdini\n\nIf you're good enough, you'll find a way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change her ways\nDo you think about it night and day?\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n\nI come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me (ooh)\nI′m not here for long\nCatch me or I go, Houdini (ha-ha-ha-ha)\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I′m not here for long)\nCatch me or I go, Houdini\n\nHoudini\n\nCatch me or I go, Houdini",
