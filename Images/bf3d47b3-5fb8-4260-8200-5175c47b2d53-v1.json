  "lyrics": "Maybe it's the way you say my name\nMaybe it's the way you play your game\nBut it's so good, I've never known anybody like you\nBut it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you\n\nAnd I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime\nAnd I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine\n\n'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine\nAnd I see forever in your eyes\nI feel okay when I see you smile, smile\n\nWishing on dandelions all of the time\nPraying to God that one day you'll be mine\nWishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time\n\nI think that you are the one for me\n'Cause it gets so hard to breathe\nWhen you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free\nWhen you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy\n\nAnd I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime\nAnd I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine\n\n'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine\nAnd I see forever in your eyes\nI feel okay when I see you smile, smile\n\nWishing on dandelions all of the time\nPraying to God that one day you'll be mine\nWishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time\n\nDandelion, into the wind you go\nWon't you let my darling know?\nDandelion, into the wind you go\nWon't you let my darling know that?\n\nI'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine\nAnd I see forever in your eyes\nI feel okay when I see you smile, smile\n\nWishing on dandelions all of the time\nPraying to God that one day you'll be mine\nWishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time\n\nI'm in a field of dandelions\nWishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine",
  "imageDescription": "A young person stands amidst a field of bright yellow dandelions, their hair and clothes gently blowing in the wind. They hold a dandelion seed head, sending white fluffy seeds into the air with a hopeful expression on their face. The sun bathes the scene in a warm, golden light, evoking feelings of yearning, romance, and youthful optimism. Dreamy, soft focus.",
