You got a crew?\nI got a crew too\nI'm not street but I do what I gotta do\n\nI've crashed up joints in Tokyo\nAnd I may not be loved,\nBut they\nAlways recall my name\n\nI'm the last man standin' yeah\nAnd I ain't never scared\n\nSmash it up smash it up\nI'm gonna kick it down\nBe cool tonight\nDon't wanna start a fight\n\nSmash it up smash it up\nTonight we kickin' it down\nAh one two three go\n\nI'm not street but I do what I gotta do\nSo what? you got a crew?\nI got a crew too\nI'm not street but I do what I gotta do\n\nCome on everybody\nMy brothers and my sisters now\nYou know that\nWe don't need no money\nTonight we're gonna kick it down\n\nCome on everybody\nWhile they sleep we rule the streets\nAnd you're not alone\nCause when we roll we roll deep yeah\nCome on everybody\nTonight there's gonna be no beef\n\nOh oh oh\n\nSmash it up smash it up\nI'm gonna kick it down\nBe cool tonight\nDon't wanna start a fight\n\nSmash it up smash it up\nTonight we kickin' it down\nAh one two three go\n\nI'm not street but I do what I gotta do\nSo what? you got a crew?\nI got a crew too\nI'm not street but I do what I gotta do",
