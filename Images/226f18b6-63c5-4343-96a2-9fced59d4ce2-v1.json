  "lyrics": "It was just two lovers, sittin′ in the car, listening to Blonde\nFallin' for each other, pink and orange skies, feelin′ super childish\nNo Donald Glover, missed call from my mother\n\nLike, \"Where you at tonight?\" Got no alibi\n\nI was all alone with the love of my life\nShe's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night\nI don't need no light to see you\n\nShine\nIt′s your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)\nYou slow down time\nIn your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)\n\nWe were just two lovers, feet up on the dash, drivin′ nowhere fast\nBurnin' through the summer, radio on blast, make the moment last\nShe got solar power, minutes feel like hours\nShe knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine\n\nFallin′ like I did for the love of my life?\nShe's got glow on her face, a glorious look in her eyes\nMy angel of light\n\nI was all alone with the love of my life\nShe′s got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night\nI don't need no light to see you\n\nShine\nIt′s your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)\nYou slow down time\nIn your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)",
