  "lyrics": "I'd pray to God that you would choke\nIf I had one\nI'd put a noose around your throat\nIf I had one\nNow, I'd put this bullet through your skull\nIf I had one\nNo, I don't have proof, but I would kill you\nIf I had some\nI'd go right back to when we met\n(If I only could)\nPut poison thoughts inside your head\n(Fuck you up for good)\nI'd love to torture you to death\n(And you know I would)\nTo make sure the cancer doesn't spread\nYou've got my confession\nYou can write this down\nYou ain't got no business\nSo shut your mouth\nNow if they find you face down in a ditch\nI hope they don't hear this\nYou took her choice away\nLike she was your prey\nAnd I bet she's not the only one\nIf you think it's in the past\nAnd you're over that\nI would only ask\nWhat would happen if I said your name?\n(What would happen if I said your name?)\nWhat would happen if I said your name?\n(What would happen if I said your name?)\nWhat would happen if I said your name?\nI'd put a scar in you for life\nIf I had the chance\nI'd make it hurt but keep you alive\nAnd I bet I can\nI'd make you feel the way she did\nWith the worst parts enhanced\nAnd then you'll be the victim of a man\nYou've got my confession\nYou can write this down\nYou ain't got no business\nSo shut your mouth\nNow if they find you face down in a ditch\nI hope they don't hear this\nYou took her choice away\nLike she was your prey\nAnd I bet she's not the only one\nIf you think it's in the past\nAnd you're over that\nI would only ask\nWhat would happen if I said your name?\n(What would happen if I said your name?)\nWhat would happen if I said your name?\n(What would happen if I said your name?)\nWhat would happen if I said your name?\nHow many men like you remain nameless",
  "imageDescription": "A dark, foreboding forest with dead trees and a blood-red sky. A single figure stands in the center of the forest, their head bowed and their hands clasped in front of them. The figure is surrounded by a pool of blood, and their clothes are stained with it.",
