  "lyrics": "You′re the beach on Christmas Eve\nWrong place, good time, consistently\nI feel like a walking love song\n\nWhen you do me like that can you tell my brain turns off?\n\nMy favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room\nAnd my heavy set of cares evaporates all around you\nEvil comes in pairs and we like what we do\nYou've got me feeling like a walking love song\n\nI must′ve caught you from 11:11\nMy lucky number seven\nI try to hide with my words\nBut you just find me clever\nI found a million places\nYou'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh\n\nFrom 7-Elevens to California Heavens\nI try to hide with my words\nBut you just find me clever\nI found a million places\nYou'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh\n\nClick your heels, I′ll take you home\nI found your slipper in the cold\nI feel like a played-out love song\nSince when′s it hurt so bad?\nCan you help me turn this off?\n\nMy favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room\nAnd my heavy set of cares evaporates all around you\nEvil comes in pairs and we like what we do\nYou've got me feeling like a walking love song\n\nI must′ve caught you from 11:11\nThe lucky number seven\nI try to hide with my words\nBut you just find me clever\nI found a million places\nYou'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh\n\nFrom 7-Elevens to California Heavens\nI try to hide with my words\nBut you just find me clever\nI found a million places\nYou′d be worth the chases to go-oh-oh\nTo go-oh-oh\n\nLet's tangle our legs again\nThe world doesn′t need us to leave our heads\nLet's tie our breath in knots again\nNothing's complicated if we pretend\n\nMy favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room\nAnd my empty set of cares evaporates all around you\nMy favorite time to stare′s when my eyes are on you\nYou′ve got me feeling like a walking love song\n\nI must've caught you from 11:11\nThe lucky number seven\nI try to hide with my words\nBut you just find me clever\nI found a million places\nYou′d be worth the chases to go-oh-oh\n\nFrom 7-Elevens to California Heavens\nI try to hide with my words\nBut you just find me clever\nI found a million places\nYou'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh\nTo go-oh-oh, go-oh-oh, go-oh-oh\n\nMy favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room\nAnd my empty set of cares evaporates all around you\nEvil comes in pairs and we like what we do\nYou′ve got me feeling like a walking love song",
