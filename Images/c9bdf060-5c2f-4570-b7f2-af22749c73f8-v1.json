  "lyrics": "I need to keep you around, with my feet tied\nWith my feet tied tight to the ground\nThe end's nowhere to be found, I don't know why\nYou don't leave me to drown, oh, oh, oh\n\nDon't know where to go unless you say\nDon't know what to do unless you stay\nThinking that today will be our day\nBe our day again\n\nWhy am I playing with time as it's ticking away?\nIt's tickin' away, away, I'm asking\nWhy we run for our lives, not a second to waste?\nYou're tickin' away, away, away\n\nAlright, let's get it\nWinnin' (winnin'), losin' (losin'), either way I'm there\nGotta attitude, I'm out the roof up in the air\nThis round I make it count, yeah, I'm talkin' right now\nFeel like the comeback kid, I got no time to spare\n\nWoah, double up the score, turn a two to a four\nYou know I win a lot, gotta win one more\nOn a hot streak, never gets old\nSolo with the ace, and my team went gold\n\nWhy am I playing with time as it's ticking away?\nIt's tickin' away, away, I'm asking\nWhy we run for our lives, not a second to waste?\nYou're tickin' away, away, away\n\nYou're ticking away, away, away\n\nYou're ticking away, away\n\nI'll give it one more try\nI don't know why, but I keep coming back every time\nI want it more than my life\nI don't know why, but it feels so right\n\nWhy am I playing with time as it's ticking away?\nIt's tickin' away, away, I'm asking\nWhy we run for our lives, not a second to waste?\nIt's tickin' away, away, away\n\nIt's ticking away, away, away\n\nTicking away, away, away",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song is a clock with its hands ticking away, surrounded by a person with their feet tied to the ground. The clock symbolizes the passing of time, while the person symbolizes the feeling of being stuck or trapped. This image captures the theme of the song, which is about the struggle to make the most of time and the fear of wasting it.",
