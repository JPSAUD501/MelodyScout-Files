  "lyrics": "Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call\n\nIt's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all\n\nBaby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day\nGive me something, oh, but you say nothing\nWhat is happening to me?\n\nI don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain\nAnd I don't wanna fit wherever\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind\n\nWondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life\n\nBaby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day\nI gave you something, but you gave me nothing\nWhat is happening to me?\n\nI don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain\nAnd I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI've been looking sad in all the nicest places\nBaby, baby, I feel crazy\nI see you around in all these empty faces\nAll night, all night and every day\nI've been looking sad in all the nicest places\nGive me something, oh, but you say nothing\nNow I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is\nWhat is happening to me?\n\nI don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain\nAnd I don't wanna fit wherever\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nI just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home\n\nUntil you come back home",
