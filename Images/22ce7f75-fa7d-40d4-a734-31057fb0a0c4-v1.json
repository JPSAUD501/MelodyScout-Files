  "lyrics": "I'm a flame\nShort of fire\nI'm the dark in need of light\nWhen we touch\nYou inspire\nFeel the change in me tonight\nSo take me up\nTake me higher\nThere's a war not far from here\nWe can dance\nIn desire\nOr we can burn in love tonight\n\nOur hearts are like\nFirestones\nAnd when they strike\nWe feel the love\nSparks will fly\nThey ignite our bones\nAnd when they strike\nWe light up the world!\n\nOur hearts are like\nFirestones\nAnd when they strike\nWe feel the love\nSparks will fly\nThey ignite our bones\nAnd when they strike\nWe light up the world\nWe light up the world\n\nWe light up the world!\nOh oh\nWoah\nOh oh\n\nFirestone\n\nI'm from X, you're from Y\nPerfect strangers in the night\nHere we are, come together\nTo the world we'll testify\n\nOur hearts are like\nFirestones\nAnd when they strike\nWe feel the love\nSparks will fly\nThey ignite our bones\nAnd when they strike\nWe light up the world\n\nWe light up the world\nOh oh\nWoah\nOh oh\nFirestone",
  "imageDescription": "A glowing heart made of fire, surrounded by darkness. The heart is radiating sparks and flames, and its light is illuminating the surrounding area. The heart is vibrant and full of energy, and it represents the passion and love between two people.",
