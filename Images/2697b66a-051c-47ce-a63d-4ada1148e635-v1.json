  "lyrics": "You can't outrun what you've done to yourself or anyone\nAnd all the things that you've seen they're real but they're dreams\n\nPromises were made and broken\nPromises were made when you were holding\nPromises made by you\nWhen will I see you?\n\nPromises were made and broken\nPromises were made when you were holding\nPromises made by you\nWhen will I see you?\n\nWent to the edge to find your center\nAnd now you've got the kind of weather you like\nOcean air away from anyone that's ever cared\nAnd there you are you're the star in heaven's eye\nMalibu's holding you tonight\n\nYou can't outrun what you feel all that's left is to heal\nAnd all the stones that you throw at yourself's a low blow\n\nPromises were made and broken\nPromises were made when you were holding\nPromises made by you\nWhen will I see you?\n\nPromises were made and broken\nPromises were made when you were holding\nPromises made by you\nWhen will I see you?\n\nWent to the edge to find your center\nAnd now you've got the kind of weather you like\nOcean air away from anyone that's ever cared\nAnd there you are you're the star in heaven's eye\nMalibu's holding you tonight",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents this song is a person standing on the edge of a cliff, overlooking a vast ocean. The person is surrounded by a serene and peaceful atmosphere, with a gentle ocean breeze blowing through their hair. The setting sun casts a warm glow on the scene, creating a sense of tranquility and hope.",
