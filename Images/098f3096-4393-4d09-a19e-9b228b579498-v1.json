  "imageDescription": "An image of a couple standing on opposite sides of a frozen lake. The lake is covered in ice and surrounded by an icy landscape. The couple's body language shows distance and coldness between them, with their arms crossed and backs turned away from each other. The frigid atmosphere reflects the emotional chill in the lyrics of the song.",
