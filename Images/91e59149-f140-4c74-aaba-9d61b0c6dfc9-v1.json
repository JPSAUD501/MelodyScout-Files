  "lyrics": "When you think of all the late nights\nLame fights over the phone\nWake up in the mornin′\n\nWith someone but feelin' alone\n\nA heart is drawn around your name\nIn someone′s handwriting, not mine\nWe're sneakin' out into town\nHoldin′ hands, just killin′ time\n\nYour past and mine are parallel lines\nStars all aligned, and they intertwined\nAnd taught you the way you call me baby\nTreat me like a lady, all that I can say is\n\nAll of the girls you loved before (ooh)\nMade you the one I've fallen for\nEvery dead-end street led you straight to me\nNow you′re all I need\nI'm so thankful for\nAll of the girls you loved before\nBut I love you more\n\nWhen I think of all the makeup\nFake love, out on the town\nCryin′ in the bathroom for some dude\nWhose name I cannot remember now\n\nSecret jokes, all alone\nNo one's home, 16 and wild\nWe′re breakin' up, makin' up\nLeave without sayin′ goodbye\n\nAnd just know that, it′s everything that made me\nNow I call you baby\nIt's why you′re so amazing\n\nAll of the girls you loved before\nMade you the one I've fallen for\nEvery dead-end street led you straight to me\nNow you′re all I need\nI'm so thankful for\nAll of the girls you loved before\nBut I love you more\n\nYour mother brought you up loyal and kind\nTeenage love taught you there′s good in goodbye\nEvery woman that you knew brought you here\nI wanna teach you how forever feels like\n\nThe girls you loved before\nMade you the one I've fallen for\nEvery dead-end street (dead-end street)\nLed you straight to me (straight to me)\nNow you're all I need (all I need)\nI′m so thankful for\nAll of the girls you loved before\nBut I love you more\n\n(I love you more)\n(I love you more)",
