  "lyrics": "Take me in the smoke\nBreathe me in and let me go\nFilling the lungs inside you\n\nIn the blacker nights\nMake my way into your mind\nJust to know what you knew\n\nRestless every time we start locking eyes\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nLost control\nOh, it′s paradise with a nasty bite\nBut I'm, ah, ah, ah, I′m with the dead of the night\nLet the darkness take control\n\nLet the darkness take control\nDarkness take control\nMay the darkness take control\n\nTake me in the smoke\nBreathe me in and let me go\nSink to your heart to find you\nOpen up your eyes\n'Til you're blinded by the lies\nSo you can see what you do\n\nRestless every time we start locking eyes\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nLost control\nOh, it′s paradise with a nasty bite\nI, ah, ah, I′m with the dead of the night\nTeardrops on the floor\nThe pain is over\nFeel the darkness\nTake control\n\nMay the darkness take control",
  "imageDescription": "An image of a person standing in a dense fog, their body partially disappearing into the mist. The fog surrounds them, symbolizing the smoke and darkness mentioned in the lyrics. The person's eyes are closed, emphasizing their surrender to the darkness and allowing it to take control. It's an eerie yet captivating image that represents the song's haunting atmosphere.",
