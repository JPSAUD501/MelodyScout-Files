  "lyrics": "She walks out with the wind\nThe psilocybin it starts to kick in\nShe gives it away with a glance and a grin\n\nBefore she leaves the room\nI am young as a child\nResting my head on the pillow, I smile\nLost in the moment I hold it awhile\nBefore sheâ€²s gone too soon\nStaring at stars and trying my hand\nThinking the thoughts of a useless man\nYoung and wild, and growing old too soon\nAnd asking the questions like who hung the moon\n\nUnder a blanket of infinite time\nDrunk on the year and the taste of the wine\nYoung and wild, and growing old too soon\nAnd asking the questions like who hung the moon",
