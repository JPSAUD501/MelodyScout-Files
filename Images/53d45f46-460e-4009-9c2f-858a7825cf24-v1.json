  "imageDescription": "In the image, a woman stands in the center with a sweet smile on one side of her face and a crazed, wild expression on the other. The background is split between a tranquil scene on the sweet side and a chaotic, twisted landscape on the psycho side. A thought bubble above her head shows the words \"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind\" repeated.",
