  "lyrics": "I know what you want\nI'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight\nIf you can keep a secret\nI got a blanket in the back seat on my mind\n\nAnd a little place that sits beneath the sky\nShe turned her face to speak but no-one heard her cry\n\nDrive faster, boy\nDrive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh\n\nI know there's a hope\nThere's too many people trying to help me cope\nYou got a real short skirt\nI wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah, yeah\nWe were just in time\nLet me take a little more off your mind\nThere's something in my head, somewhere in the back, saying\n\"We were just a good thing, we were such a good thing\"\n\nMake it go away without a word\nBut promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard\n\nOh, make it go away\nDrive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh\nOh, no\n\nA crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl\nWith jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls\nI took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier\nOf stars in atmosphere and watched her disappear\n\nInto the midnight show\nFaster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster\nOh no, no, no, no, no, no\nNo, no, no, no, no\n\nIf can you keep a secret\nWell, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret\nIf can you keep a secret, I can keep a secret\nIf can you keep a secret\nWell, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret",
  "imageDescription": "A car speeding down a dark highway, with the night sky above. In the backseat, there is a blanket, symbolizing secrecy. The image captures the sense of urgency and the hidden desires conveyed in the song.",
