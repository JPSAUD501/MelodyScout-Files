  "lyrics": "I see you\nYou see me\nHow pleasant\nThis feeling\nThe moment\nYou hold me\nI missed you\nI'm sorry\nI've given\nWhat I have\nI showed you\nI'm growing\nThe ashes\nFall slowly\nAs your voice\nConsoles me\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know\n\nWe're swaying\nTo drum beats\nIn motion\nI'm feeling\nMy patience\nControlling\nThe question\nI won't speak\nWe're telling\nThe stories\nOur laughter\nHe knows me\nWe're leaving\nWe're talking\nYou're closer\nIt's calming\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know\n\nThe night will hold us close \nAnd the stars will guide us home\nI've been waiting for this moment\nWe're finally alone\nI turn to ask the question\nSo anxious, my thoughts\nYour lips were soft like winter\nIn your passion, I was lost\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know\n\nAs the hours pass\nI will let you know\nThat I need to ask\nBefore I'm alone\nHow it feels to rest\nOn your patient lips\nTo eternal bliss\nI'm so glad to know",
