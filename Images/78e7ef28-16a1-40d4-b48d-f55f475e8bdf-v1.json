All the enjoyment\nI'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend\nIt's not what he's made for\nWhat was I made for?\n\n'Cause I, 'cause I\nI don't know how to feel\nBut I wanna try\nI don't know how to feel\nBut someday I might\nSomeday I might\n\nThink I forgot how to be happy\nSomething I'm not, but something I can be\nSomething I wait for\nSomething I'm made for\nSomething I'm made for",
