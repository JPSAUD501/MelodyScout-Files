  "lyrics": "Why can′t you want me like the other boys do?\nThey stare at me while I stare at you\n\n\nSummertime, East Side New York City\nIt's too hot to sleep\nHalf-alive, and my mind is drippin′\nI'm twistin' the sheets\n\n′Cause my heart can′t be satisfied\nBy anyone but you tonight\nAnd when I try, it only makes me blue\n\nWhy can't you want me like the other boys do?\nThey stare at me while I stare at you\nWhy can′t you want me, baby, what can I do?\nI don't want other boys, I just want you\nI don′t want other boys, I just want you\nI don't want other boys\n\nSilhouettes, a city of shadows\nThey all take your shape\nIn my defense, you′ve got me unraveled\nAnd I can't see straight\n\n'Cause my heart can′t be satisfied\nBy anyone but you tonight\nAnd when I try, it only makes me blue (why?)\n\nWhy can′t you want me like the other boys do?\nThey stare at me while I stare at you\nWhy can't you want me, baby, what can I do?\nI don′t want other boys, I just want you\nI don't want other boys, I just want you\nI don′t want other boys (I just want you)\n\nWhy can't you want me like the other boys do?\nThey stare at me while I stare at you\nWhy can′t you want me, baby, what can I do?\nI don't want other boys, I just want you",
  "imageDescription": "A simple and creative image that represents the song is a black and white photograph of a cityscape at dusk. The silhouette of a person is standing on a rooftop, looking out towards the city. The buildings are tall and shadowed, symbolizing the \"silhouettes, a city of shadows\" mentioned in the lyrics. The image captures the longing and desire expressed in the song, with the person yearning for someone who doesn't seem to want them back.",
