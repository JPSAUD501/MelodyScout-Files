  "lyrics": "Left my house with a book of matches\nTo try to burn this city down\nInstead I drove into the ocean\n\nAnd started swimming till I drowned\n′Cause I'm a liar, liar, blood on fire\nAs drunk as I was\nAnd the ships sailed by\n\nAnd the sharks in the water make me realize that death is real\nAnd there′s nothing at all that makes you feel as small as dying will\nGhosts have a way to make regrets feel so alive\nBut it's the death in us all\nThat keep the hopes finding something better\n\nI left my house with that book of matches\nAnd all the worsts intentions found\nI locked my kids down inside the basement\nAnd burned their dreams straight to the ground\n'Cause I′m a liar, liar, blood on fire\nAs fucked as I was\nAnd the ship sank down\n\nAnd the sharks in the water make me realize that death is real\nAnd there′s nothing at all that makes you feel as small as dying will\nAnd ghosts have a way to make regrets feel so alive\nBut it's the death in us all\nThat keeps the hope of finding something better",
  "imageDescription": "A burning house in the middle of a dark forest. The flames are reaching up to the sky, and the smoke is billowing out of the windows. The house is surrounded by trees, and the only light comes from the fire.",
