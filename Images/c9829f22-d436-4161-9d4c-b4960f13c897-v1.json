  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI-I-I-I-I'm not done grieving the one that came before you\nOn the run, from my plug, to New York\nI don't want you to be the reason that it's over\nSo I'm sorry if it seems like I'm cold\n\n[Bridge]\nI know how it looks, I'm one foot in\nTrust me when I say it's genuine\nIt's hard to shake the memories in my gut\nYou're scared that you're my backup\nCry myself to sleep, but it's not you I'm thinking of\n\n[Chorus]\nNever again, never again\nThat's what I told myself\nNever again, well I guess it depends\nDoes love ever еnd?\nIf not don't let me in\n\n[Verse 2]\nPlanned a futurе by myself but you're the present\nShared your bed, overheard your chest, you're in love\nBooked a red eye to hear, I'm claustrophobic\nIt's game over but I'm tip-toeing\nHide and seek out in the open\n\n[Chorus]\nNever again, never again\nThat's what I told myself\nNever again, well I guess it depends\nDoes love ever end?\nIf not don't let me in\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Outro]\nI know how it looks, I'm one foot in\nTrust me when I say it's genuine\nIt's hard to shake the memories in my gut\nYou're scared that you're my backup\nCry myself to sleep, but it's not you I'm thinking of",
