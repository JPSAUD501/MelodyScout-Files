  "lyrics": "I′m 24 now\nStill at my parents house\nThought I would have it figured out\n\nFriends getting married, one has a baby\nI barely recognize this town\n\nMama asked me what my plan is for the future\nBut I don't even know what′s going on for dinner\nI'm 24 now, thought I could finally settle down\n\nParties end before I'm drunk\nFriday night I′m tired as fuck\nI don′t know how I ended up like this\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed? (Missed, yeah)\n\nBirthday's here, I′m still depressed\nGot no friends, just lots of stress\nIt feels like yesterday when we were kids\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n'Cause I don′t know\n\nSleep till the sun's down, another breakdown\nFeels like the days are all the same\nNew type of anxious, school never taught this\nAnd what the fuck are taxes anyway?\n\nI tell myself I won′t be cynical and bitter\nAnd now I see it when I'm looking in the mirror\nI'm 24 now, wondering when I will be okay\n\nParties end before I′m drunk\nFriday night I′m tired as fuck\nI don't know how I ended up like this\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n\nBirthday′s here, I'm still depressed\nGot no friends, just lots of stress\nIt feels like yesterday when we were kids\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n′Cause I don't know\n\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh) ′cause I don't know\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh) 'cause I don′t know\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh) yeah\n\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n′Cause I don't know",
  "imageDescription": "A young woman sits alone at a table in a dimly lit room. She is staring at her birthday cake, which has one lit candle. Her head is in her hands, and she is surrounded by empty pizza boxes and beer cans. The room is messy and cluttered, with clothes and books strewn about.",
