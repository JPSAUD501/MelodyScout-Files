  "imageDescription": "A simple image that best represents the song is a person sitting alone in a dimly lit room, their phone in front of them. The room is cluttered with empty boxes and cellophane wrap, symbolizing the packaging up of pain. Despite the dark atmosphere, a ray of light shines through a crack in the window, symbolizing hope and the possibility of escape from the pain.",
