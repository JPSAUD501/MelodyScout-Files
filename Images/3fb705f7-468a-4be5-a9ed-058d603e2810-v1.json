  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nBlame, blame, blame\n\n[Verse 1]\nAdderall and television, play it like a politician\nYou can't stop the twitching in your eye, right?\nArtificial altruism, looking for a fuss to give and\nAll you want is just another couple hundred likes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's easier if I'm to blame\nYeah, it's easier if I'm to blame\nIt's easier if I'm to blame\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's easier if I'm the one you blame for everything\nFor every single memory in your brain\nWe both got stories, but they're not the same\nSo make believe, eventually you can forget my name\nBut it's easier if I'm the one you blame\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWe both got stories, but they're not the same\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlcohol and ammunition, melancholic disposition\nAdd it to the story in your mind, right?\nKnow-it-alls, they never listen, God forbid a poor decision\nNow I know why I still regret you\nAerosol and tunnel vision, prerecorded mannerisms\nCouldn't stop the twitching in my eye\nI disregard the pessimism, disappoint the algorithm\nAll we want is just another couple hundred likes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's easier if I'm to blame\nYeah, it's easier to numb the pain\nIt's easier if I'm to blame\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's easier if I'm the one you blame for everything\nFor every single memory in your brain\nWe both got stories, but they're not the same\nSo make believe, eventually you can forget my name\nBut it's easier if I'm the one you blame\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(If I could take it all back, I wouldn't take it all back now)\nWe both got stories, but they're not the same\n(If I could take it all back, I wouldn't take it all back now)\nBlame, blame, blame\n\n[Bridge]\nTry to save some face, I can't say I blame you now\n(Adderall and television, play it like a politician)\nBless your selfish ways, only you can save you now\n(Alcohol and ammunition)\nI won't hold it against you\nWon't hold it against you\n(It's easier to blame)\nI won't hold it against you\nWon't hold it against you\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's easier if I'm the one you blame for everything\nFor every single memory in your brain\nWe both got stories, but they're not the same\nSo make believe eventually you can forget my name\nBut it's easier if I'm the one you blame\n\n[Outro]\nBlame it all on me (Oh-woah-oh)\nBlame, blame, blame\nIf I could take it all back\nI wouldn't take it all back now (Oh-woah-oh)\nBlame, blame, blame",
