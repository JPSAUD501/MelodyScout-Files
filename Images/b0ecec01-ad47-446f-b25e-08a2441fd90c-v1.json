  "lyrics": "So sick and tired of being alone\nSo long, farewell, I′m on my own\nI'm sorry mom, I′ve got to go\n\nI dug this grave I call my home\n\nMy life don't mean that much to me\nSo I'm living for you\nYeah, I′m living for you\nAnd you can′t stand the sight of me\nSo what's the point of this\nFucked up catastrophe?\n\nI′m waiting for my time to start\nAs I waste it\nAs I waste it\nI pop the pills to waste some time\nAs I'm faded\nAs I′m faded\n\nThis shit messes with my head\nThe only home I know is my bed\nToo lazy for suicide\nI just watch the days pass hoping to die\n\nSo sick and tired of being alone\nSo long, farewell, I'm on my own\nI′m sorry mom, I've got to go\nI dug this grave I call my home\n\nSo sick and tired of being alone\nSo long, farewell, I'm on my own\nI′m sorry mom, I′ve got to go\nI dug this grave I call my home\n\nDaydreaming of my funeral\nLike who would show, bet no one would go\nHey dad, would you show up for me now?\nJust to bury your little boy in the ground\n\nYou broke my heart when you left me\nWas just waiting\nWas just waiting\nI pop these pills to waste some time\nAs I'm faded\nAs I′m faded\n\nThis shit messes with my head\nThe only home I know is my bed\nToo lazy for a suicide\nI just watch the days pass hoping to die\n\nSo sick and tired of being alone\nSo long, farewell, I'm on my own\nI′m sorry mom, I've got to go\nI dug this grave I call my home\n\nSo sick and tired of being alone\nSo long, farewell, I′m on my own\nI'm sorry mom, I've got to go\nI dug this grave I call my home\n\nI dug this grave I call my home\nI dug this grave!",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that best represents the song is a dark, empty room with a single bed in the center. The room is dimly lit, with shadows cast on the bare walls. The bed is unmade and messy, symbolizing the protagonist's state of mind and their feelings of loneliness and despair. The image captures the somber and introspective tone of the lyrics.",
