(As I tear you to pieces?)\nAm I beautiful? (Am I beautiful?)\nEven at my ugliest, you always say\nI'm beautiful (am I beautiful)\nAs you tear me to pieces (as you tear me to pieces)\nYou are beautiful (you are beautiful)\nEven at your ugliest, I always say\nYou're beautiful and sick like me\n\nIs it sick of me to feed the animal in you?\nIs it sick to say \"I tease the hunter\" like I do?\nIs it sick of me to watch the wicked way you thrill?\nIs it sick to say I live to break your will?\n\nAre you sick like me?\n\nAm I beautiful (am I beautiful)\nAs I tear you to pieces? (As I tear you to pieces?)\nAm I beautiful? (Am I beautiful?)\nEven at my ugliest, you always say\nI'm beautiful (am I beautiful)\nAs you tear me to pieces (as you tear me to pieces)\nYou are beautiful (you are beautiful)\nEven at your ugliest, I always say\nYou're beautiful and sick like me\n\nSick\nSick\nSick\nSick\nSick\nSick\nSick\n\nAm I beautiful as I tear you to pieces?\nI am beautiful\nEven at my ugliest, you always say\nI'm beautiful (am I beautiful)\nAs I tear you to pieces (as I tear you to pieces)\nAm I beautiful? (Am I beautiful?)\nEven at my ugliest, you always say\n\nI'm beautiful (am I beautiful)\nAs you tear me to pieces (as you tear me to pieces?)\nYou are beautiful (you are beautiful)\nEven at your ugliest, I always say\nYou're beautiful and sick like me\n\nSick",
