  "lyrics": "How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?\nAren't you really supposed to know that shit?\nFeel it in your bones and own that shit?\nI don't know\n\nThen I had this interaction I've been thinking 'bout for like five weeks\nWonder if he's thinking 'bout it too and smiling\nWonder if he knows that that's been what's inspiring me\nWonder if he's judging me like I am right now\nI don't care\nI'd rather tell the truth\nThan make it worse for you\n\nIf the sun refused to shine\nBaby, would I still be your lover?\nWould you want me there?\nIf the moon went dark tonight\nAnd if it all ended tomorrow\nWould I be the one on your mind?\nYour mind? Your mind?\n\nAnd if it all ended tomorrow\nWould you be the one on mine?",
