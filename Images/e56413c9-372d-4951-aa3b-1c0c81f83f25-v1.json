(Ah)\nI need something that'll make me believe (ah)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nIf you're good enough, you'll find a way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change her ways\nDo you think about it night and day?\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n\nI come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nHoudini\nCatch me or I go Houdini",
  "imageDescription": "A magician dressed in a black suit and hat stands in the center of a stage. He is surrounded by a cloud of smoke, and there are several doves flying around him. In one hand he holds a deck of cards, and in the other hand he holds a wand. The magician is looking directly at the viewer with a confident smile on his face.",
