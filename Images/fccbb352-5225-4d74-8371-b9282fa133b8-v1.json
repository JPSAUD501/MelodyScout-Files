  "lyrics": "I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care\nBut it's so cold and I don't know where\nI brought you daffodils in a pretty string\nBut they won't flower like they did last spring\n\nAnd I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright\nI'm just so tired to share my nights\nI wanna cry and I wanna love\nBut all my tears have been used up\n\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up, up\n\nAnd if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight\nBut my hand's been broken one too many times\nSo I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude\nWords, they always win, but I know I'll lose\n\nAnd I'd sing a song that'd be just ours\nBut I sang 'em all to another heart\nAnd I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love\nBut all my tears have been used up\n\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up, up\n\nOh, need a love, now\nMy heart is thinking of\n\nI wanna sing a song that'd be just ours\nBut I sang 'em all to another heart\nAnd I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love\nBut all my tears have been used up\n\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up\nOn another love, another love\nAll my tears have been used up, up",
