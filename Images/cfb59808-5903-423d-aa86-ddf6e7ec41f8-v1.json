  "lyrics": "I still remember the third of December, me in your sweater\nYou said it looked better on me than it did you\nOnly if you knew how much I liked you\n\nBut I watch your eyes as she\n\nWalks by\nWhat a sight for sore eyes\nBrighter than the blue sky\nShe′s got you mesmerized while I die\n\nWhy would you ever kiss me?\nI'm not even half as pretty\nYou gave her your sweater, it′s just polyester\nBut you like her better\nWish I were Heather\n\nWatch as she stands with her, holding your hand\nPut your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder\nBut how could I hate her? She′s such an angel\nBut then again, kinda wish she were dead as she\n\nWalks by\nWhat a sight for sore eyes\nBrighter than the blue sky\nShe′s got you mesmerized while I die\n\nWhy would you ever kiss me?\nI'm not even half as pretty\nYou gave her your sweater, it′s just polyester\nBut you like her better\nI wish I were Heather\n\n(Oh, oh)\n\nI wish I were Heather\n(Oh, oh)\n\nWish I were Heather\n\nWhy would you ever kiss me?\nI'm not even half as pretty\nYou gave her your sweater, it′s just polyester\n\nBut you like her better\nWish I were",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song \"Heather\" is a girl watching from a distance as her crush and another girl walk hand in hand. The girl she idolizes, Heather, is depicted as a radiant figure with a glowing aura, contrasting against the plain and cold surroundings. The girl watching feels invisible and wishes she could be like Heather, wishing for her beauty and the affection her crush gives to her.",
