(Woah-oh-oh-oh)\n\nIt seems like we've been losing control\nSomebody tell me I'm not alone\nWhen I say\n\nAll I need's a little love in my life\nAll I need's a little love in the dark\nA little but I'm hoping it might kick start\nMe and my broken heart\nI need a little loving tonight\nHold me so I'm not falling apart\nA little but I'm hoping it might kick start\nMe and my broken heart\n\nUh, maybe some part of you just hates me\nYou pick me up and play me\nHow do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)\nOne time tell me you need me tonight\nTo make it easy, you lie\nAnd say it's all for love (woah-oh-oh-oh)\n\nIt seems like we've been losing control\nSomebody tell me I'm not alone\nWhen I say\n\nAll I need's a little love in my life\nAll I need's a little love in the dark\nA little but I'm hoping it might kick start\nMe and my broken heart\nI need a little loving tonight\nHold me so I'm not falling apart\nA little but I'm hoping it might kick start\nMe and my broken heart\n\nMe and my broken heart\nMe and my broken\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nIt's just me\nIt's just me\nIt's just me\nMe and my broken heart\n\nAll I need's a little love in my life (baby)\nAll I need's a little love in the dark\nA little but I'm hoping it might kick start\nMe and my broken heart\nI need a little loving tonight\nHold me so I'm not falling apart\nA little but I'm hoping it might kick start\nMe and my broken heart",
