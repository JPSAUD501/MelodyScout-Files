  "imageDescription": "A stylish woman with sparkling skin poses in a mirror, bathed in soft, seductive lighting. She holds a wrapped gift, her expression a mix of playful confidence and anticipation. A figure lurks in the background, obscured by shadow, their desire palpable. The scene has a voyeuristic, film noir feel.",
