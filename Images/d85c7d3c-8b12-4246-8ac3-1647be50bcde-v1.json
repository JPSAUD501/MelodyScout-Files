  "lyrics": "Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go\nWill I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know\nChasing after you is like a fairytale, but I\nFeel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel\n\nCome, come one, come all\nYou must be this tall\nTo ride this ride at the carnival\n\nOh, come, take my hand\nAnd run though playland\nSo high, too high at the carnival\n\nAnd it's all fun and games\n'Til somebody falls in love\nBut you already bought a ticket\nAnd there's no turning back now\n\nRound and round like a horse on a carousel, we go\nWill I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know\nChasing after you is like a fairytale, but I\nFeel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel\n\nThis horse is too slow\nWe're always this close\nAlmost, almost, we're a freakshow\n\nRight, right when I'm near\nIt's like you disappear\nWhere'd you go? Mister Houdini, you're a freakshow\n\nAnd it's all fun and games\n'Til somebody falls in love\nBut you already bought a ticket\nAnd there's no turning back now\n\nRound and round like a horse on a carousel, we go\nWill I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know\nChasing after you is like a fairytale, but I\nFeel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel\n\nWhy did you steal my cotton candy heart?\nYou threw it in this damn coin slot\nAnd now I'm stuck, I'm stuck\nRiding, riding, riding\n\nRound and round like a horse on a carousel, we go\nWill I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know\nChasing after you is like a fairytale, but I\nFeel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel",
  "imageDescription": "A colorful carousel horse spinning in circles with a rider reaching out towards love. The image captures the excitement and playfulness of the carnival, but also the feeling of being stuck in a never-ending cycle of chasing after someone. The vibrant colors and movement convey the whimsical and slightly bittersweet nature of the song.",
