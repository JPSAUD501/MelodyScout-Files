  "lyrics": "Oh, I've done it again\nDug a little deep, and it's all caved in\nNow I free fall in a black hole\nI know I'm getting warm 'cause I feel so cold\n\nBut I'm looking on the bright side now\nTrying to figure out somehow (None of this is real, no)\nIt's looking like a write off now\nI think we need to talk, like, now\n\nSo don't swear to God, He never asked you\nIt's not his heart you drove a knife through\nIt's not his world you turned inside out\nNot his tears still rolling down\nJesus Christ, you're so damn cold\nDon't you know you've lost control?\nForget about the things you think I know\nNo secrets, you can't keep me\n\nDeathblow, look at you go\nBrought a T-62 to a Rodeo\nSo tall, it broke the fourth wall\nGuess my fairytale has a few plot holes\n\nWell, I'm looking on the bright side now\nTrying to figure out somehow (None of this is real, no)\nYou can give the act up now\nGo ahead and take a bow\n\nSo don't swear to God, He never asked you\nIt's not his heart you drove a knife through\nIt's not his world you turned inside out\nNot his tears still rolling down\nJesus Christ, you're so damn cold\nDon't you know you've lost control?\nForget about the things you think I know\nNo secrets, you can't keep me\n(In the dark, in the dark)\nNo secrets, you can't keep me\n(In the dark, in the dark)\n\nI'm not looking for salvation\nJust a little faith in anyone or anything\nI'm not looking for salvation\nJust a little faith in anyone or anything\nI'm not looking for salvation (Oh no, could this all come caving in?)\nJust a little faith in anyone or anything\nI'm not looking for salvation\nJust a little faith in anyone or anything\nAnd it's time I knew you, so\n\nDon't swear to God, He never asked you (Oh no)\nIt's not his heart you drove a knife through (Oh no)\nIt's not his world you turned inside out (So look me in the eye right now)\nNot his tears still rolling down\nJesus Christ, you're so damn cold\nDon't you know you've lost control?\nForget about the things you think I know\nNo secrets, you can't keep me (In the dark)\nDon't swear to God, He never asked you\nIt's not his heart you drove a knife through (In the dark)\nIt's not his world you turned inside out\nNot His tears still rolling down \nJesus Christ, you're so damn cold\nDon't you know you've lost control?\nForget about the things you think I know\nNo secrets, you can't keep me (In the dark)\nDon't swear to God, He never asked you (Oh no)\nIt's not his heart you drove a knife through (In the dark)\nIt's not his world you turned inside out (Oh no)\nNot His tears still rolling down (You're so damn cold)\nJesus Christ, you're so damn cold (You're so damn cold)\nDon't you know you've lost control? (Oh)\nForget about the things you think I know (Oh)\nNo secrets, you can't keep me\n(In the dark, in the dark)\nNo secrets, you can't keep me\n(In the dark, in the dark, in the dark)",
