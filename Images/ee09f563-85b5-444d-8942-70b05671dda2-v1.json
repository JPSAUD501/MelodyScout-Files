  "lyrics": "The distance from the man that I am to the man I want to be\nThe time it takes to realize time is the distance I need\n\nBut I was born impatient\nAnd I was born unkind\nBut I refuse to believe I have to be\nThe same person I was born when I die\n'Cause change is alright\nChange is alright\n\nI'm not proud of all the choices I've made for a lot of my life\n\nFollowing the shadow when I damn well know that behind me is the light\n\nBut I've lied to my mother\nI made people feel like hell\nBut I refuse to believe I have to keep\nBeing cruel 'cause I'm a coward myself\n\nAnd time is impatience\nNo, patience takes time\n\nExcuses will only do good if you're waiting around to die\n\nEveryone is born with self worth\nHow easily it turns to doubt\nIt takes letting go of what we know we can't live without\n\nBut the blood in the water\nIs the blood of my brother\nWe both learned it didn't mean a thing in\nThe end if one was thicker than the other\nAnd I've tried having faith\nBut I'll rot like a dog\n'Cause I've always been scared of loving\nSomeone just a little bit more than I'm loved\n\nLosing is fine\n\nEverything is fine",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song is a person standing at a crossroads, with one path leading towards darkness and the other towards light. The person is hesitating, unsure of which path to choose. This image captures the theme of self-reflection, the struggle to change and make better choices, and the fear of vulnerability and love.",
