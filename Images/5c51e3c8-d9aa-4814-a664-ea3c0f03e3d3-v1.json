  "lyrics": "I was distracted\nAnd in traffic\nI didn't feel it\nWhen the earthquake happened\nBut it really got me thinkin'\nWere you out drinkin'?\nWere you in the living room\nChillin' watchin' television?\nIt's been a year now\nThink I've figured out how\nHow to let you go and let communication die out\n\nI know, you know, we know \nYou weren't down for forever and it's fine\nI know, you know, we know \nWe weren't meant for each other and it's fine\n\nBut if the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over and you'd stay the night\nWould you love me for the hell of it?\nAll our fears would be irrelevant\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nThe sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight\nAnd there wouldn't be a reason why\nWe would even have to say goodbye\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nRight?\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nRight?\n\nI tried to imagine\nYour reaction\nIt didn't scare me when the earthquake happened\nBut it really got me thinkin'\nThat night we went drinkin'\nStumbled in the house\nAnd didn't make it past the kitchen\nAh, it's been a year now\nThink I've figured out how\nHow to think about you without it rippin' my heart out\n\nI know, you know, we know \nYou weren't down for forever and it's fine\nI know, you know, we know \nWe weren't meant for each other and it's fine\n\nBut if the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over and you'd stay the night\nWould you love me for the hell of it?\nAll our fears would be irrelevant\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nThe sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight\nNo, there wouldn't be a reason why\nWe would even have to say goodbye\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?\n\nI know, you know, we know \nYou weren't down for forever and it's fine\nI know, you know, we know \nWe weren't meant for each other and it's fine\n\nBut if the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over and you'd stay the night\nWould you love me for the hell of it?\nAll our fears would be irrelevant\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nThe sky'd be falling while I hold you tight\nNo, there wouldn't be a reason why\nWe would even have to say goodbye\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?\n\nIf the world was ending\nYou'd come over, right?",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that best represents the song is a couple holding hands, standing together against a backdrop of a crumbling world. The sky is dark and chaotic, symbolizing the impending disaster, while the couple's connection and love serve as a source of comfort and hope amidst the chaos.",
