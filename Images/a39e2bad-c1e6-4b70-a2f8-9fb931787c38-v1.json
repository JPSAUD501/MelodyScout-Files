  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song \"Zombie\" by The Cranberries is a broken heart, with tears streaming down, surrounded by barbed wire. The heart symbolizes the pain caused by violence, while the barbed wire represents the barriers that prevent understanding and resolution. The tears reflect the sadness and mourning for the lives lost.",
