  "lyrics": "Oh\nOh\n\nYou are my church, you are my place of worship\nI heard you're the plug, can I be the circuit?\nWhen I got court, I hope that you're the verdict\nWhen you're around, my insides turn inverted\nMy blood starts to rush when I see your doorman\nI know you're nearby and I know your purpose\nTake one look at you, you're heaven's incarnate\nWhat is this spell, baby? Please show some mercy\n\nMelting like an ice cream when you smile\nMelting, you're a daydream, stay a while\n\nI pray that I can learn to be funny\nI'm watching every stand-up comedy\nJust hoping that it'll rub off on me\nSo you'll smile at everything I say\nYou got some soft lips and some pearly whites (pearly whites)\nI wanna touch them in the dead of night (dead of night)\nYour smile ignites just like a candlelight (candlelight)\nThen somehow, I know everything's alright\n\nMelting like an ice cream when you smile\nMelting, you're a daydream, stay a while\n\nMelting like an ice cream when you smile\nMelting, you're a daydream, stay (melting)",
