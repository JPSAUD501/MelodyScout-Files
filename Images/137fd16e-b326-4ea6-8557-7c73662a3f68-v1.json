  "lyrics": "I'm the girl you've been thinking about\nThe one thing you can't live without\nYeah, I'm the girl you've been waiting for\nI'll have you down on your knees\nI'll have you begging for more\nYou probably thought I wouldn't get this far\nYou thought I'd end up in the back of a car\nYou probably thought that I'd never escape\nI'd be a rat in a cage, I'd be a slave to this place\nYou don't know how hard I fought to survive\nWaking up alone when I was left to die\nYou don't know about this life I've lived\nAll these roads I've walked\nAll these tears I've bled\n\nSo how can this be?\nYou're praying to me\nThere's a look in your eyes\nI know just what that means\nI can be, I can be your everything\n\nI can be your whore!\nI am the dirt you created\nI am your sinner\nI am your whore\nBut let me tell you something baby\nYou love me for everything you hate me for\n\nI'm the one that you need and fear\nNow that you're hooked, it's all becoming clear\nThat all your judgments that you placed on me\nWas a reflection of discovery\nSo maybe next time when you cast your stones\nFrom the shadows of the dark unknown\nYou will crawl up from your hiding place\nTake a look in the mirror\nSee the truth in your face\n\nSo how can this be?\nYou're praying to me\nThere's a look in your eyes\nI know just what that means\nI can be, I can be your everything\n\nI can be your whore!\nI am the dirt you created\nI am your sinner\nI am your whore\nBut let me tell you something baby\nYou love me for everything you hate me for\n\nOh whoa ho, oh whoa ho, oh whoa ho\n\nI am the dirt you created\nI am your sinner\nI am your whore\nBut let me tell you something baby\nYou love me, you want me, you need me!\n\nI can be your whore!\nI am the dirt you created\nI am your sinner\nI am your whore\nBut let me tell you something baby\nYou love me for everything you hate me for\n\nI can be your whore!\n\nI can be your whore!\nI can be your whore!\nBut let me tell you something baby\nYou love me for everything you hate me for\nYou love me for everything you hate me for",
  "imageDescription": "In the image, a woman stands tall and confident against a dark, stormy backdrop. She wears a torn, black dress symbolizing her resilience and strength. Her reflection in a shattered mirror reveals her true self, unapologetically owning her flaws and embracing her power. The image captures the juxtaposition of vulnerability and empowerment conveyed in the song's lyrics.",
