  "imageDescription": "In the image, a woman stands confidently in the center, surrounded by flames. Her body is half angelic, half demonic, symbolizing her duality and power. Above her head, a crown made of thorns and a halo blend together, representing her as both a goddess and a martyr. The background is a mix of vibrant colors, depicting the clash of light and darkness.",
