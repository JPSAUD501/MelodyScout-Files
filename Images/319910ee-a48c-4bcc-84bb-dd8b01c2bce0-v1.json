  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents this song is a person sitting alone on a park bench, looking longingly at someone across the street. The summer sun casts a warm glow, and the silhouette of the person blends with the city's shadows. It captures the yearning and desire expressed in the lyrics, as well as the feeling of being alone in a crowded city.",
