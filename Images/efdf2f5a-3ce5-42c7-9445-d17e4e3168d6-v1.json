  "lyrics": "I should have known\n\nI′d leave alone\n\nJust goes to show\nThat the blood you bleed\nIs just the blood you owe\n\nWe were a pair\nBut I saw you there\nToo much to bear\nYou were my life, but life is far away from fair\n\nWas I stupid to love you?\nWas I reckless to help?\nWas it obvious to everybody else?\n\nThat I'd fallen for a lie\nYou were never on my side\nFool me once, fool me twice\nAre you death or paradise?\nNow you′ll never see me cry\nThere's just no time to die\n\nI let it burn\nYou're no longer my concern, mmm\nFaces from my past return\nAnother lesson yet to learn\n\nThat I′d fallen for a lie\nYou were never on my side\nFool me once, fool me twice\nAre you death or paradise?\nNow you′ll never see me cry\nThere's just no time to die\n\nNo time to die, mmm\nNo time to die, ooh\n\nFool me once, fool me twice\nAre you death or paradise?\nNow you′ll never see me cry\nThere's just no time to die",

The cracked mirror represents the broken trust and the shattered illusion of love. It symbolizes the pain and realization that the person was deceived, left alone to pick up the pieces.",
