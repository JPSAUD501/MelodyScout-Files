  "lyrics": "If you could only feel the way that I feel\nReady for the war to come my way\nYeah, I struggled so I know what it takes\nThe pressure only builds 'til it breaks\nIf you could only feel the way that I feel\n\nYou might think it's something spiritual\n\nBut I'm betting on the \"right here, right now\"\nTo Hell with all the \"someday, somehow\"\nI've waited long enough\nI've waited long enough\n(Don't need a miracle)\nRight here, right now\nTo Hell with all the \"someday, somehow\"\nI've waited long enough\nI've waited long enough\n(Don't need a miracle)\nYou might think it's something spiritual\nBut I don't need a fucking miracle\n\nIf you could only see the way that I see\nYou could find the faith to take the leap\nIt only took one shot to prove I'm not made of glass\nThere's no pain you could cause that won't eventually pass\nIf you could only see the way that I see\n\nYou'd be betting on the \"right here, right now\"\nTo Hell with all the \"someday, somehow\"\nI've waited long enough\nI've waited long enough\n(Don't need a miracle)\nRight here, right now\nTo Hell with all the \"someday, somehow\"\nI've waited long enough\nI've waited long enough\n(Don't need a miracle)\nYou might think it's something spiritual\nBut I don't need a fucking miracle\n\nNo weapon formed against me shall prosper\nMy will is stronger\nStronger\nWait\n\nYou might think it's something spiritual\n\nBut I'm betting on the \"right here, right now\"\nTo hell with all the \"someday, somehow\"\nI've waited long enough\nI've waited long enough\n(Don't need a miracle)\nRight here, right now\nTo hell with all the \"someday, somehow\"\nI've waited long enough\nI've waited long enough\n(Don't need a miracle)\nYou might think it's something spiritual\nBut I don't need a fucking miracle\nMiracle",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a person standing at the edge of a cliff, ready to jump into a vast, open sky. Below them, a pool of shattered glass represents the struggles they've faced. Above them, a vibrant rainbow signifies hope and resilience. The person's outstretched arms show their readiness to embrace the present moment and reject the need for miracles, as they believe in their own strength and determination.",
