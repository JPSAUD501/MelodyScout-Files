  "lyrics": "I don't usually go all in, babe\nBut you're a hum that I had to play\nAnd you took me all the way\nMake me lose more than I could win, babe\nAnd I really need to let you know\n\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\nI'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care\nAnd I know you're thinking the worst of me\nBut I hope one day you'll see\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI don't usually overdose\nBut you're a drug that I had to take\nAnother fix, I couldn't wait\nNow the edge is far too close\nSo I really need to let you know\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you\n\nYou took me to a place so far from here\nYou took me to another atmosphere\nBut I got so high, I couldn't breathe\nAnd I've been holding, holding, holding, holding, holding, holding\n\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\nI'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care\nAnd I know you're thinking the worst of me\nBut I hope one day you'll see\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you",
