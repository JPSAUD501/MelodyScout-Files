  "imageDescription": "A lone figure sits at a bar, neon lights reflecting in their sad eyes as they gaze at a forgotten T-shirt. A ghost of a loved one, translucent and filled with regret, reaches out but cannot connect. The scene is awash in blues and purples, blending melancholy with the lingering warmth of what could have been.",
