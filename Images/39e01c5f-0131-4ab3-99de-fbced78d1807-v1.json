  "lyrics": "I'm just the elephant in the room\nWhat's your best excuse?\nI'm just the elephant in the room\n\nDo you really wanna be the one\nThat makes this so uncomfortable tonight?\nWhen you could be one\nTo set the record straight, you think it's not the perfect time\nI wish I could be the one to make it easy\nBut I'll remind ya that you're gonna hurt some feelings\nSo you slide around the issues and lay low\nHeaven forbid you got to dirty up the halo\n\nSo\nI'm not gonna let this go\nDon't know what you're waiting for\nI'm not gonna let you go\n\nSo\nI'm just the elephant in the room\nWhat's your best excuse?\nI'm just the elephant in the room\nBetter think this through\nYou don't wanna talk about your feelings\nI'll be in the corner with the reasons\nI'm just the elephant\nI'm just the elephant in the room\nIn the room\n\nI'm gonna be the darkest secret\nThat you can't forget and keep back in your mind (My mind)\nSo when people ask what's wrong with you\nYou can't explain what's killing you inside (Inside)\nI don't know why you got to cheat on what you stand for\nYou try to look away but I'm too big to ignore\nI can lay off if you say so\nA guilty conscious is obnoxious with no pay though\n\nSo\nI'm not gonna let this go\nDon't know what you're waiting for\nI'm not gonna let you go\n\nSo\nI'm just the elephant in the room\nWhat's your best excuse? (Best excuse)\nI'm just the elephant in the room\nBetter think this through\nYou don't wanna talk about your feelings\nI'll be in the corner with the reasons\nI'm just the elephant\nI'm just the elephant in the room\nIn the room",
  "imageDescription": "The image is of a large, looming elephant standing in the middle of a pristine, white room. The elephant represents the unspoken issues and uncomfortable truths that are being ignored. It is a constant presence, impossible to ignore, symbolizing the weight of the unsaid words and hidden feelings. The simplicity of the image highlights the stark contrast between the elephant and the clean, empty room.",
