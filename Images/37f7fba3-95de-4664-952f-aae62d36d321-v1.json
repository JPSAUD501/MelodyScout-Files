  "imageDescription": "A solitary tree stands in a frozen landscape, covered in a blanket of snow. Its branches are bare, reaching upwards towards the sky. The air is crisp and cold, with frost visible on the tree's trunk. The image represents the melancholic and introspective mood of the song, capturing the sense of stillness and longing for a time when things were alive and vibrant.",
