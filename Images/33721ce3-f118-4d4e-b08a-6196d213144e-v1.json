  "lyrics": "I need to get something off my chest\nCuz lately I have been upset\nYou make me wanna dress in red\nAnd sing with my head out the window\n\nI know it's better to be cold\nBetter to wonder than to know\nAnd so I'm gonna play the role\n\nThere might be some tears on my pillow\nDon't know what I want\nBut I know I really really wanna cling to you\nYeah my heart is innocent\nBut my body really really wanna sin with you\n\nWe could be lovers in the night\nWe could be strangers in the light\nIs it going too fast for you?\nGoing too fast for you\nLovers in the night\nWe could be strangers in the light\nIf it's going too fast for you\n\nWe don't need to put a label on it do we now?\nOh my love\nWe don't need to put a label on it do we now?\nOh my love\n\nBaby, I know your love is bad\nGuess that is why I wanna have it\nYou make me walk on broken glass\nAnd sing with my head out the window\nWatching every tiny move you make\nWhile I pretend to look away\nYou know I'll take what I can get\n\nThere might be some tears on my pillow\nDon't know what I want\nBut I know I really really wanna cling to you\nYeah my heart is innocent\nBut my body really really wanna sin with you\n\nWe could be lovers in the night\nWe could be strangers in the light\nIs it going too fast for you?\nGoing too fast for you\nLovers in the night\nWe could be strangers in the light\nIf it's going too fast for you\n\nWe don't need to put a label on it do we now?\nOh my love\nWe don't need to put a label on it do we now?\nOh my love\nLabel why not do you know\nOh, would you cling to me all night long?\nAll night long, all night long\nRepeat the ballads on and on\nYeah, yeah\nOh, would you cling to me all night long\nAll night long, all night long\nMorning will hurt but it's so far gone\nYeah yeah\n\nWe could be lovers in the night\nWe could be strangers in the light\nIs it going too fast for you?\nGoing too fast for you\nLovers in the night\nWe could be strangers in the light\nIf it's going too fast for you\n\nWe don't need to put a label on it do we now?\nOh my love\nWe don't need to put a label on it do we now?\nOh my love",
