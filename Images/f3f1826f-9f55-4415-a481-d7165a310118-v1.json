  "lyrics": "Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself \nBut you should've told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else \nYou're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down \nYour phone's been off for a couple months, so you're calling me now\nâ€¦ ",
  "imageDescription": "A vibrant, abstract painting of a shattered mirror, with fragments of different colors scattered across the canvas. One piece shows a person at a party, another depicts a broken-down car, and yet another reveals a phone with a series of missed calls. The shattered mirror symbolizes the fragmented thoughts and emotions being revealed through the song's lyrics.",
