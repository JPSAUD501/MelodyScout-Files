  "lyrics": "Water crashing through my mind\nYou're so ugly when you cry, baby\nMake a sound and I'll shut you up\nKeeping it rough but call it love\n\nYou've been checking under your bed to see if I'm there\nWhen you look back up, I'm under you pulling your hair\nGetting lost inside my world, you don't know where I've been\nOh no, oh no\nI feel it coming\n\nAnd I tried to save a life\nWith these diamond hands of mine\nBut they're sharper than a knife\nI am aimed to kill\nAnd I tried to fix a heart\nWith these lips that left some scars\nI swear I won't do no harm\nShh, I am aimed to kill\n\nI am aimed to kill\nI am made to kill\nLove the thrill\nI am aimed to kill\nI am made to kill\nThere's a killer on the run\nSomeone call 911\nI am aimed to kill\n\nCall me monster or a saint\nI'll still get you either way, baby\nIf you scream, I will tie you up\nKeeping it rough but call it love\n\nYou've been checking under your bed to see if I'm there\nWhen you look back up, I'm under you pulling your hair\nGetting lost inside my world, you don't know where I've been\nOh no, oh no\nI feel it coming\n\nAnd I tried to save a life\nWith these diamond hands of mine\nBut they're sharper than a knife\nI am aimed to kill\nAnd I tried to fix a heart\nWith these lips that left some scars\nI swear I won't do no harm\nShh, I am aimed to kill\n\nI am aimed to kill\nI am made to kill\nLove the thrill\nI am aimed to kill\nI am made to kill\nThere's a killer on the run\nSomeone call 911\nI am aimed to kill\n\nI feel it coming\nMy soul cannot be found\nI feel it coming\nDon't fucking tie me down\nI feel it coming\nNo, I can't stop it now\nThe Devil's got my vows\n\nAnd I tried to save a life\nWith these diamond hands of mine\nBut they're sharper than a knife\nI am aimed to kill\nAnd I tried to fix a heart\nWith these lips that left some scars\nI swear I won't do no harm\nShh, I am aimed to kill\n\nI am aimed to kill\nI am made to kill\nLove the thrill\nI am aimed to kill\nI am made to kill\nThere's a killer on the run\nSomeone call 911\nI am aimed to kill\n\nI feel it coming\nMy soul cannot be found\nI feel it coming\nDon't fucking tie me down\nI feel it coming\nNo, I can't stop it now\nThe Devil's got my vows\nI am aimed to kill",
