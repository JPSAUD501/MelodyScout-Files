  "lyrics": "Find an island far away from me\nA shipwreck lost at sea\nWhere nobody goes, no search party\nNobody knows but me\n\nBoth shared a single rope\nTrying to stay afloat\nThe treasure that you blew\nWhen I was tied to you\n\nWe reeled each other in\nGot caught up in the wind\nOur sails, they pulled too hard\nAnd we fell off our raft\n\nIf our own mistakes are too much to take\nIf this just won't work and we can't find a way\nMaybe our maps go different ways, go different ways\n\nFind an island far away from me\nA shipwreck lost at sea\nWhere nobody goes, no search party\nNobody knows but me\n\nFind an island far away from me\nA shipwreck lost at sea\nWhere nobody goes, no search party\nNobody knows but me\n\nFind an island\nFind an island\n\nSlowly you drifted off\nPutting us on the rocks\nNo longer want to know\nWhere you make plans to go\n\nI built this boat to last\nYou chose to move too fast\nA storm has swept right through\nAnd washed away of you\n\nIf our own mistakes are too much to take\nIf this just won't work and we can't find a way\nMaybe our maps go different ways, go different ways\n\nFind an island far away from me\nA shipwreck lost at sea\nWhere nobody goes, no search party\nNobody knows but me\n\nFind an island far away from me\nA shipwreck lost at sea\nWhere nobody goes, no search party\nNobody knows but me\n\nFind an island\nFind an island\n\nAnd if our own mistakes are too much to take\nIf this just won't work and we can't find a way\nMaybe our maps go different ways, go different ways\n\nFind an island far away from me (far away from me)\nA shipwreck lost at sea (at sea)\nWhere nobody goes, no search party (party)\nNobody knows but me\n\nFind an island far away from me (away from me)\nA shipwreck lost at sea (at sea)\nWhere nobody goes, no search party (party)\nNobody knows but me",
  "imageDescription": "A lone boat, battered and broken, is stranded on a rocky shore. The boat is surrounded by crashing waves and a dark, stormy sky. The boat is empty, and there is no sign of life.",
