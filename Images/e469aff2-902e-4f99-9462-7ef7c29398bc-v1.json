  "imageDescription": "The image is a broken mirror, shattered into countless pieces. Each fragment reflects a different aspect of the singer's emotions - pain, strength, longing. Despite being on the outside, isolated and disconnected, they still hold on and find power within themselves. The broken mirror symbolizes the fractured state of their relationship, while also representing the beauty and resilience found in embracing their individuality.",
