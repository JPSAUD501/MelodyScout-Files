  "imageDescription": "A dark storm cloud hovers ominously over a city skyline, crackling with lightning. The cloud is shaped like a menacing face, with glowing eyes and a wide, toothy grin. The city below is in chaos, with people running and buildings in disarray. The image captures the impending danger and fear depicted in the song.",
