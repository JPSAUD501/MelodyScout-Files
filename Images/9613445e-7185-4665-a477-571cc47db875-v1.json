I guess so\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\nMove it up, down, left, right, oh\nSwitch it up like Nintendo\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\n\nI can't relate to desperation\nMy 'give a fucks' are on vacation\nAnd I got this one boy\nAnd he won't stop calling\nWhen they act this way\nI know I got 'em\n\nToo bad your ex don't do it for ya\nWalked in and dream came trued it for ya\nSoft skin and I perfumed it for ya\nI know I Mountain Dew it for ya\nThat morning coffee, brewed it for ya\nOne touch and I brand newed it for ya\n\nNow he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh\nIs it that sweet? I guess so\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\nMove it up, down, left, right, oh\nSwitch it up like Nintendo\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\n\nIs it that sweet? I guess so\n\nI'm working late 'cause I'm a singer\nOh, he looks so cute wrapped around my finger\nMy twisted humor, make him laugh so often\nMy honey bee, come and get this pollen\n\nToo bad your ex don't do it for ya\nWalked in and dream came trued it for ya\nSoft skin and I perfumed it for ya\nI know I Mountain Dew it for ya\nThat morning coffee, brewed it for ya\nOne touch and I brand newed it for ya\n\nNow he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh\nIs it that sweet? I guess so\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\nMove it up, down, left, right, oh\nSwitch it up like Nintendo\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\n\nHe's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh\nIs it that sweet? I guess so\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\nMove it up, down, left, right, oh\nSwitch it up like Nintendo\nSay you can't sleep, baby, I know\nThat's that me, espresso\n\nIs it that sweet? I guess so\nThat's that me, espresso",
