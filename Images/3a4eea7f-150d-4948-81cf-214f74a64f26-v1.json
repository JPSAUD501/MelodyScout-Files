  "lyrics": "I miss the taste of a sweeter life\nI miss the conversation\nI'm searching for a song tonight\nI'm changing all of the stations\n\nI like to think that we had it all\nWe drew a map to a better place\nBut on that road, I took a fall\nOh baby, why did you run away?\n\nI was there for you in your darkest times\nI was there for you in your darkest night\n\nBut I wonder, where were you?\nWhen I was at my worst down on my knees\nAnd you said you had my back\nSo I wonder, where were you?\nWhen all the roads you took came back to me\nSo I'm following the map that leads to you\n\nThe map that leads to you\nAin't nothing I can do\nThe map that leads to you\nFollowing, following, following to you\n\nThe map that leads to you\nAin't nothing I can do\nThe map that leads to you\nFollowing, following, following\n\nI hear your voice in my sleep at night\nHard to resist temptation\n'Cause something strange has come over me\nNow, I can't get over you\nNo, I just can't get over you\n\nI was there for you in your darkest times\nI was there for you in your darkest night\n\nBut I wonder, where were you?\nWhen I was at my worst down on my knees\nAnd you said you had my back\nSo I wonder, where were you?\nWhen all the roads you took came back to me\nSo I'm following the map that leads to you\n\nThe map that leads to you\nAin't nothing I can do\nThe map that leads to you\nFollowing, following, following to you\n\nThe map that leads to you\nAin't nothing I can do\nThe map that leads to you\n\nOh, oh, oh, ah\nOh, oh, oh, ah\nYe, ye, ye, ah\nAh, ah, mmh, ah\n\nOh, I was there for you\nOh, in your darkest times\nOh, I was there for you\nOh, in your darkest night\n\nOh, I was there for you\nOh, in your darkest times\nOh, I was there for you\nOh, in your darkest night\n\nBut I wonder, where were you?\nWhen I was at my worst down on my knees\nAnd you said you had my back\nSo I wonder, where were you?\nWhen all the roads you took came back to me\nSo I'm following the map that leads to you\n\nThe map that leads to you\nAin't nothing I can do\nThe map that leads to you\nFollowing, following, following to you\n\nThe map that leads to you\nAin't nothing I can do\nThe map that leads to you\nFollowing, following, following",
  "imageDescription": "A road map spread out on a wooden table. The map is old and worn, with many creases and tears. A red marker has been used to trace a route from one city to another. The route is long and winding, and it passes through many different towns and villages. A compass sits next to the map, and a magnifying glass rests on top of the route.",
