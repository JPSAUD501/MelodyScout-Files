Waiting on you, babe\n\nOoh, ooh-ooh-ooh\nNight to morning, live slow-motion\n\nI got all I need, you know nothing else can beat\nThe way that I feel when I′m dancing with my girls\nPerfect energy, yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free\nThere's no better feeling in the whole wide world\n\nTonight, I don′t care what's wrong or right\nDon't start blowing up my line, I′d care at 11:59\nBut nothing counts after midnight\n\nAh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, hahaha\nOoh, ooh-ooh-ooh\nBy the morning, feel like magic\n\nI got all I need, you know nothing else can beat\nThe way that I feel when I′m dancing with my girls\nPerfect energy (uh-huh), yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free\nThere's no better feeling in the whole wide world\n\nTonight, I don′t care what's wrong or right\nDon′t start blowing up my line, I'd care at 11:59\nDon′t start blowing up my line",
