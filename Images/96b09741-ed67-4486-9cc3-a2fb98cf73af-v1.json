  "imageDescription": "An image of a colorful blimp floating in the sky, with the words \"E=MC squared\" written on it. Inside the blimp, there is a person with a wild and carefree expression on their face, surrounded by swirling clouds and dragons. The blimp is flying over a surreal landscape, with a mental institution resembling a cuckoo's nest below.",
