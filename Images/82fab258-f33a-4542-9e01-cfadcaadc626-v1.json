  "imageDescription": "Two people standing close together, their bodies glowing with a warm, golden light. They are surrounded by a dark background, and the only light comes from their bodies. The man and woman are looking into each other's eyes, and they are both smiling. They look like they are in love and completely devoted to each other.",
