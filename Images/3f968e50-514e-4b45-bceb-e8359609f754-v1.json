  "imageDescription": "The image is a close-up of a woman's face, her lips stained with red lipstick. Smoke curls around her hair, blending with the vibrant colors of the Los Angeles skyline. Boy-shaped necklaces hang from her neck, symbolizing the power she holds over them. The image captures her confidence and rebelliousness, embodying the song's themes of dominance and self-indulgence.",
