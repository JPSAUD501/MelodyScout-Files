  "lyrics": "I lost my own belief\nAlways something breaking me, was overcome\nWalking these lonely streets\nEven in good company, I want to run\n\nBut now I'm embracing the way I am\nI don't need nobody to hold my hand\n\nI'm doing it, doing it all by myself\nI'm moving it, moving it all by myself\nI'll be my own motivation\nI'll listen to nothing they're saying\nI'm loving me, loving me all by myself\n\nAll by myself\nAll by myself, myself\nAll by my\n\nThey turned the best of me into my insecurities\nThey shout so loud\nNo parties with fake friends\nI never wanna blend into the crowd\n\nNo more going places I don't belong\nThey're gonna say I'm selfish, but I'm just strong\n\nI'm doing it, doing it all by myself\nI'm moving it, moving it all by myself\nI'll be my own motivation\nI'll listen to nothing they're saying\nI'm loving me, loving me all by myself\n\nAll by myself \nAll by my-my-my\nAll by myself, myself\n\nNo more going places I don't belong\nYou can say I'm selfish, but I'm just strong\nAnd now I'm breaking free from what they wanted me to be\nAnd I'm me, finally, oh\n\nI'm doing it, doing it all by myself-self-self\nAll by myself-self-self-self\nI'll be my own motivation\nI'll listen to nothing they're saying\nI'm loving me, loving me all by myself\n\nAll by myself, myself\nAll by myself\nAll by my-my-my\nAll by myself, myself\nAll by myself",
  "imageDescription": "A lone figure walks confidently down a neon-lit city street, back turned to the camera, ignoring the whispers and blurred faces of the crowd. They're bathed in a warm inner light, headphones on, with a determined expression. Graffiti art style, vibrant colors, and a sense of liberation. \n",
