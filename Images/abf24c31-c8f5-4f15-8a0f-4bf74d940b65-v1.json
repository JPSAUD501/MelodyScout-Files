  "lyrics": "My grandpa fought in World War II\nHe was such a noble dude\nI can't even finish school\nMissed my mom, and left too soon\n\nHis dad was a fireman\nWho fought fires so violent\nI think I bored my therapist\nWhile playing him my violin\n\nthat's so insane\n(Oh, my God) that's such a shame\nNext to them, my shit don't feel so grand\nBut I can't help myself from feeling bad\nI kinda feel like two things can be sad (one, two, three, four)\n\nThe world's smallest violin\nReally needs an audience\nSo if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)\nI'll blow up into smithereens\nAnd spew my tiny symphony\nJust let me play my violin for you, you, you, you\n\nMy grandpa fought in World War II\nAnd he was such a noble dude\nMan, I feel like such a fool\nI got so much left to prove\n\nAll my friends have vaping friends\nThey're so good at making friеnds\nI'm so scared of caving in\nIs that entertaining yеt?\n\nthat's so insane\n(Oh, my God) that's such a shame\nNext to them, my shit don't feel so grand\nBut I can't help myself from feeling bad\nI kinda feel like two things can be sad (one, two, three, four)\n\nThe world's smallest violin\nReally needs an audience\nSo if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)\nI'll blow up into smithereens\nAnd spew my tiny symphony\nJust let me play my violin for you, you, you, you\n\nSomewhere in the universe\nSomewhere someone's got it worse\nWish that made it easier\nWish I didn't feel the hurt\n\nThe world's smallest violin\nReally needs an audience\nSo if I do not find somebody soon\n\nI'll blow up into smithereens\nAnd spew my tiny symphony\nAll up and down a city street\nWhile tryna put my mind at ease\nLike finishing this melody\nThis feels like a necessity\nSo this could be the death of me\nOr maybe just a better me\n\nNow, come in with the timpanis\nAnd take a shot of Hennessy\nI know I'm not there mentally\nBut you could be the remedy\nSo let me play my violin for you",
  "imageDescription": "A small, delicate violin sits on a worn wooden table. The room is dimly lit, with a single spotlight highlighting the instrument. The image captures the vulnerability and longing expressed in the song, as if the violin is waiting to be played, yearning for an audience to hear its melancholic melody.",
