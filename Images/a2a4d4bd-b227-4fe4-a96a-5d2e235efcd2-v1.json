  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song \"Who Do You Love\" is a broken heart-shaped locket, lying open on a dark wooden table. The locket is tarnished and the chain is tangled, symbolizing the broken trust and betrayal in a relationship. The dim lighting in the room adds to the somber atmosphere, reflecting the emotional turmoil expressed in the lyrics.",
