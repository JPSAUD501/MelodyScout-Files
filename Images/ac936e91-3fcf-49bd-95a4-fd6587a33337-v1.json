  "lyrics": "I struggle in most of my songs\nAbout how deep to get\nBut before I can make up my mind\nI'm at the bottom of the\nDeep end out of breath\nI'm tired all the time\nI'm cutting my own line\n\nWriters block has building blocks\nAnd built these walls around me\nI don't feel lucky in here\nBuried in my head\nI'm seeing red and nothing else i feel\n\nMad all the time mad all the time\nMad all the time mad all the time\n\nI'm afraid of heights\nBut I'm done with this place\nSo I want to go up until we run out of space\nI feel like I expired in Houston last year\nWatching my friends finish college\nWhile I'm all alone out here\nI'm tired all the time\nI'm cutting my own line\n\nMad all the time mad all the time\nMad all the time mad all the time\n\nMy sneezing fit's will never let me focus\nMy brains and my hands\nEntirely both know this\nI feel most safe in my bedroom\nClimbing the walls of my headroom\nSo keep out of my room because\nI think I've seen enough of you today\n\nMad all the time mad all the time\nMad all the time mad all the time",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a person submerged in a pool of water, struggling to stay afloat. The water represents the overwhelming feeling of writer's block and the walls surrounding them symbolize the mental barriers that prevent creativity. The person's tired expression and outstretched hand cutting their own lifeline depict their exhaustion and desperation to break free from the constraints of their mind.",
