  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLet me tell you all about “my” life\nSpeaking in a round of “someone”’s life\nEvery now and then off once or twice\nEverything all ends up right it seems\nSuffocating sun is blinding the eyes\nDrowning in a feeling choking the mind\nCounting on the rain to douse the skies\nHow do I survive the thundering?\nLoving and the hate all wash away\nLoving and the hate all wash away\nTell me where it is you hide the pain\nSmiling alight so gracefully\nSpitting out a phrase without a shape\nSpitting out a phrase without a shape\nSomewherе on the road we lost our way\nHow can I convey thе same to you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCollecting all the scraps of dreams that never came\nHey, wait, hey wait\nSeems it all was my mistake\n\n[Chorus]\nAh\n“Now and then, now and then”\n“I’ll just break again” it’s\nBitter, the cold, the cold, the cold, the cold\nBitter, the cold, the cold, the cold, the cold\nBitter, the cold, the cold, the cold\nYou left me alone now\nAh\nWhat is left what is left\nOh the words you said? it’s\nFading away, away, away, away\nFading away, away, away, away\nFading away, away, away\nI’m breaking in pain, so\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAny place you can find my name\nIt would be okay cause just the thought is all it takes\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery little promise ever we made\nEvery little promise ever we made\nCarrying the weight of each mistake\nSomehow, we arrive at the coming of day\nLoving and the hate all wash away\nLoving and the hate all wash away\nTell me where it is you hide the pain\nSmiling alight so gracefully\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n“A pair of flowers budding calms me ever so”\nAlthough, although\nYou had all but lost your hope\n\n[Chorus]\nAh\nChasing dreams, chasing dreams\nEver out of reach it’s\nSpeeding away, away, away, away\nSpeeding away, away, away, away\nSpeeding away, away, away\nI can’t keep the pace the\nFeelings that can’t be erased\nBid my blood to take it’s\nHurting, a rage, a rage, a rage, a rage\nHurting, a rage, a rage, a rage, a rage\nHurting, a rage, a rage, a rage\nIt’s never the same, right?\n\n[Bridge]\nAh\nThis is just how I dreamed\nOr, it seemed to be but\n\n[Chorus]\nCrying alone, alone, alone, alone\nCrying alone, alone, alone, alone\nCrying alone, alone, alone\nDon’t come any closer\nTrading the code we had made\nIn our better days is\nBitter, the cold, the cold, the cold, the cold\nBitter, the cold, the cold, the cold, the cold\nBitter, the cold, the cold, the cold\nIs all that I know, so\nAny place you can find my name\nIt would be okay, so let me keep it all the same",
