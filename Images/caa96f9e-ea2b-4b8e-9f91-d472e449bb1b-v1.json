  "lyrics": "Waking up next to you in the middle of the week\nNever needed anyone to send me off to sleep\nAnd I know I said, \"Go Slow\"\n\nBut I can′t hold back no more\nGot a premonition this ain't gonna be a fling\n\nYou make a weekend feel like a year\nBaby, you got me changing\n24-7, I want you here\nI hope you feel the same thing\n\nI want you to be the one that′s on my mind\nOn my mind, on my mind\nI want you to be there on a Monday night\nTuesday night, every night\nAre you gonna be the one that's on my mind?\n3-6-5, all the time\nI want you to be the one to stay\nAnd give me the night and day\n\nLove it when you come back and can't take it when you leave\nGot me fantasizing our initials already\nAnd I wanna just let go\nFall in deeper than before\nSay that you are ready, lock it up in a heart beat\n\nI want you to be the one that′s on my mind\nOn my mind, on my mind\nI want you to be there on a Monday night\nTuesday night, every night\nAre you gonna be the one that′s on my mind?\n3-6-5, all the time\nI want you to be the one to stay\nAnd give me the night and day\n\nI think about you all the time\n24-7, 3-6-5\nI think about you all the time\n24-7, 3-6-5\n\nAre you gonna be the one?\n\nAre you gonna be the one? (Are you gonna be the one?)\n\nI want you to be the one\nI want you to be the one that's on my mind\nOn my mind, on my mind\nI want you to be there on a Monday night\nTuesday night, every night\nAre you gonna be the one that′s on my mind?\n3-6-5, all the time\nI want you to be the one to stay\nAnd give me the night and day\n\nI think about you all the time\n24-7, 3-6-5\nI think about you all the time\n24-7, 3-6-5",
