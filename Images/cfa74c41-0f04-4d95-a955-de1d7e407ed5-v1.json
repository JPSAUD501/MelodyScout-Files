  "imageDescription": "An image of a juicy, vibrant tangerine with a mischievous smile on its face, standing on a balance scale. On one side, there is a halo representing sweetness, and on the other side, there is a devil horn representing sourness. The tangerine represents the duality of the song, being both sweet and sour, and the balance represents the choice between good and bad.",
