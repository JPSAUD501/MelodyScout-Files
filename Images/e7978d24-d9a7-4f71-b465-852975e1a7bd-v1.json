  "lyrics": "I don't usually go all in, babe\nBut you're a hum that I had to play\nAnd you took me all the way\nMake me lose more than I could win, babe\nAnd I really need to let you know\n\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\nI'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care\nAnd I know you're thinking the worst of me\nBut I hope one day you'll see\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI don't usually overdose\nBut you're a drug that I had to take\nAnother fix, I couldn't wait\nNow the edge is far too close\nSo I really need to let you know\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you\n\nYou took me to a place so far from here\nYou took me to another atmosphere\nBut I got so high, I couldn't breathe\nAnd I've been holding, holding, holding, holding, holding, holding\n\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\nI'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care\nAnd I know you're thinking the worst of me\nBut I hope one day you'll see\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a heart-shaped bank, cracked and broken, with money pouring out of it. Each dollar bill represents a piece of love that has been taken away. The bank is suspended in a dark void, symbolizing the emptiness and loss caused by the person who has been robbing the heart. The image captures the vulnerability and pain conveyed in the lyrics of the song.",
