  "lyrics": "Did you really think, I'd just forgive and forget, no\nAfter catching you with her\nYour blood should run cold, so cold\nYou, you two-timing, cheap-lying, wannabe\nYou're a fool, if you thought that I'd just let this go\n\nI see red, red, oh red\nA gun to your head, head, to your head\nNow all I see is red, red, red\n\nDid you really just say, she didn't mean anything, oh\nI'll remember those words, when I come for your soul, your soul\nKnow that you, you dug your own grave, now lie in it\nYou're so cruel, but revenge is a dish best served cold\n\nI see red, red, oh red\nA gun to your head, head, to your head, oh\nExecutioner style, and there won't be no trial\nDon't you know that you're better off dead\nAll I see is red, red, oh red\nNow all I see is\n\nRun, hide\nOh, you're so done\nOh, better sleep with one eye open tonight\n\nI see red, red, oh red, oh\nA gun to your head, head, to your head, oh\nExecutioner style, and there won't be no trial\nDon't you know that you're better off dead\nAll I see is red, red, oh red\nNow all I see is red, red",
  "imageDescription": "A woman consumed by rage, engulfed in crimson light, eyes burning with fury. A shattered portrait of a couple lies at her feet, a single red rose dripping onto the shards. In the background, a blurred silhouette of a fleeing lover, fear etched on his face. Gritty, film noir style, emphasizing shadows and dramatic lighting.  \n",
