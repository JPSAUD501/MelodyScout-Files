  "lyrics": "All the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nI let it fall, my heart\nAnd as it fell, you rose to claim it\nIt was dark and I was over\nUntil you kissed my lips and you saved me\n\nMy hands, they're strong\nBut my knees were far too weak\nTo stand in your arms\nWithout falling to your feet\n\nBut there's a side to you\nThat I never knew, never knew\nAll the things you'd say\nThey were never true, never true\nAnd the games you play\nYou would always win, always win\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nBut I set fire\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a burning raindrop, with flames flickering off its edges. The raindrop represents the tears shed, and the fire symbolizes the intense emotions felt. The contrast between the raindrop and the fire represents the internal struggle between vulnerability and strength. The image captures the raw intensity and passion of the song.",
