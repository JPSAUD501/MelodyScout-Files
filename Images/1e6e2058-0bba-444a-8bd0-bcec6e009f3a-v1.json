  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've seen the world, done it all\nHad my cake now\nDiamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now\nHot summer nights, mid-July\nWhen you and I were forever wild\nThe crazy days, city lights\nThe way you'd play with me like a child\n\n[Chorus]\nWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?\nWill you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?\nI know you will, I know you will, I know that you will\nWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now\nChanneling angels in the new age now\nHot summer days, rock and roll\nThe way you'd play for me at your show\nAnd all the ways I got to know\nYour pretty face and electric soul\n\n[Chorus]\nWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?\nWill you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?\nI know you will, I know you will, I know that you will\nWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?\n\n[Bridge]\nDear Lord, when I get to heaven\nPlease, let me bring my man\nWhen he comes, tell me that You'll let him in\nFather, tell me if You can\nAll that grace, all that body\nAll that face makes me wanna party\nHe's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds\n\n[Chorus]\nWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?\nWill you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?\nI know you will, I know you will, I know that you will\nWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?\n\n[Outro]\nWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?\nWill you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song \"Young and Beautiful\" is a fading rose, once vibrant and full of life, now wilting and losing its petals. It symbolizes the fleeting nature of beauty and the question of whether love will endure beyond physical appearance.",
