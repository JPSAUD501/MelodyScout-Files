  "lyrics": "My castle crumbled overnight\nI brought a knife to a gunfight\nThey took the crown, but it's alright\nAll the liars are calling me one\nNobody's heard from me for months\nI'm doing better than I ever was\n\n'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream\nWalkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to\nSo call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to\nMy baby's fly like a jet stream\nHigh above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new\nSo call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to\n\nAll my flowers grew back as thorns\nWindows boarded up after the storm\nHe built a fire just to keep me warm\nAll the drama queens taking swings\nAll the jokers dressin' up as kings\nThey fade to nothin' when I look at him\n\nAnd I know I make the same mistakes every time\nBridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right\nI did one thing right\nI'm laughin' with my lover, makin' forts under covers\nTrust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right\nStarry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night\n\nMy baby's fit like a daydream\nWalkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to\nSo call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to\nMy baby's fly like a jet stream\nHigh above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new\n(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)\nSo call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to\n\nI want to wear his initial\nOn a chain 'round my neck, chain 'round my neck\nNot because he owns me\nBut 'cause he really knows me\nWhich is more than they can say, I\nI recall late November\nHoldin' my breath, slowly I said\n\"You don't need to save me\nBut would you run away with me?\"\nYes (would you run away?)\n\nMy baby's fit like a daydream\nWalkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to\n(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)\nSo call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to\nMy baby's fly like a jet stream\nHigh above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new\n(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)\nSo call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to\n\nCall it what you want, yeah, call it what you want\nTo",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a vibrant, colorful painting of a castle crumbling and in ruins, with flowers growing out of the cracks and thorns. In the foreground, there is a figure holding a knife, representing the inner struggle. But behind them, there is a person walking with their head down, reaching out a hand to the figure, symbolizing love and support. The painting captures the contrast between the chaos and pain of the past and the hope and redemption of the present.",
