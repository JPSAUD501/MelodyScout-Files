  "imageDescription": "In the image, a closed velvet rope barrier separates two worlds. On one side, there's a vibrant, bustling cityscape bathed in daylight. On the other side, a dimly lit room with a solitary figure looking out, longing to be a part of the lively scene. The rope symbolizes exclusion and the struggle to be accepted, while the contrasting environments represent the divide between those who belong and those who don't.",
