  "imageDescription": "A vibrant sunset over a tropical beach, with palm trees swaying in the breeze. The sky is a mix of warm oranges and pinks, reflecting off the calm ocean waves. Two figures are silhouetted in the foreground, holding hands and watching the sun dip below the horizon. The image captures the blissful, carefree atmosphere of the song.",
