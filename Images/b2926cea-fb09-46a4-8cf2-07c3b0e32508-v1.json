  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCan't be sleeping, keep on waking\nWithout the woman next to me\nGuilt is burning, inside I'm hurting\nThis ain't a feeling I can keep\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\nBlame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\n\n[Chorus]\nBlame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\nSo blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\nDon't blame it on me\n\n[Drop]\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan't you see it? I was manipulated\nI had to let her through the door\nOh, I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed\nShe needed me to talk\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\nBlame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\n\n[Chorus]\nBlame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\nSo blame it on the ni-i-i-i-ight\nDon't blame it on me, don't blame it on me\nDon't blame it on me\n\n[Drop]\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby\n(Oh, I promise, I'll be better this time), yeah\n(I will be better this time, I will)\nOh, I got to say (Oh, I promise)\n(I'll be better this time)\n(I will be better this time, I will), I'm so sorry\nOh, I promise (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't blame it on me\nDon't blame it on me-e-e-e-e\n\n[Drop]",
  "imageDescription": "The image is of a lone figure standing in front of a dark, stormy night sky. The figure is looking up, with a pained expression on their face. Rain is falling, symbolizing their guilt and inner turmoil. It represents the feeling of being blamed for something they couldn't control, as conveyed in the song's lyrics.",
