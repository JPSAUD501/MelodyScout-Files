  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song is a carousel with a broken heart as one of the horses. The carousel is spinning rapidly, symbolizing the chaotic emotions and struggles the singer faces. The broken heart represents the self-destructive nature of the lyrics, with the singer realizing that they have the power to hurt themselves without needing anyone else's help.",
