  "lyrics": "I'm going back to 505\nIf it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive\nIn my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side\nWith your hands between your thighs\n\nStop and wait a sec\nWhen you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?\nI'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck\nOr I did last time I checked\n\nNot shy of a spark\nThe knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark\nFrightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark\nThe middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start\n\nI'm going back to 505\nIf it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive\nIn my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side\nWith your hands between your thighs\n\nBut I crumble completely when you cry\nIt seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye\nI'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise\nTake my hands off of your eyes too soon\n\nI'm going back to 505\nIf it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive\nIn my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side\nWith your hands between your thighs and a smile",
