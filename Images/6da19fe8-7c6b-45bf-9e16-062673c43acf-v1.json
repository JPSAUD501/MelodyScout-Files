(Yeah)\nPlease, don't you see I'm live? (I'm live)\nSo if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over\n\nMe and the PS5\nLeast you know where I'ma be at night (yeah)\nScore's never been this high (so high)\nSo if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over\n\nMe or the PS5\nMe or the PS5\nMe or the PS5",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents this song is a split-screen view of a person sitting on a couch, torn between their significant other and a PS5 gaming console. On one side, the person is looking longingly at their partner, while on the other side, they are fully engrossed in playing a video game. The image symbolizes the internal conflict and decision the person must make between love and their gaming obsession.",
