  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe'd take the world off my shoulders\nIf it was ever hard to move\nShe'd turn the rain to a rainbow\nWhen I was living in the blue\nWhy then, if she's so perfect\nDo I still wish that it was you?\nPerfect don't mean that it's workin'\nSo what can I do? (Ooh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you're out of sight\nIn my mind\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinkin' of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHopin' I'll find a glimpse of us\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me he savors your glory\nDoes he laugh the way I did?\nIs this a part of your story?\nOne that I had never lived\nMaybe one day, you'll feel lonely\nAnd in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse\nMaybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you're out of sight\nIn my mind\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinkin' of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHopin' I'll find a glimpse of us\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinkin' of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHopin' I'll find a glimpse of us",
  "imageDescription": "An image of a person standing in the rain, with a faint rainbow appearing in the distance. The person's face is turned away, looking wistfully at the rainbow, while their current partner stands beside them, trying to offer comfort. It represents the longing for a past love and the struggle to fully move on, despite being in a new relationship.",
