  "lyrics": "Thought I found a way\nThought I found a way out (found)\nBut you never go away (never go away)\n\nSo I guess I gotta stay now\n\nOh, I hope some day I′ll make it out of here\nEven if it takes all night or a hundred years\nNeed a place to hide, but I can't find one near\nWanna feel alive, outside I can′t fight my fear\n\nIsn't it lovely? All alone\nHeart made of glass, my mind of stone\nTear me to pieces, skin to bone\nHello, welcome home\n\nWalking out of town\nLooking for a better place (looking for a better place)\nSomething's on my mind\nAlways in my head space\n\nBut I know someday I′ll make it out of here\nEven if it takes all night or a hundred years\nNeed a place to hide, but I can′t find one near\nWanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear\n\nIsn′t it lovely? All alone\nHeart made of glass, my mind of stone\nTear me to pieces, skin to bone\nHello, welcome home\n\nWoah, yeah\nYeah, ah\nWoah, woah\n\nHello, welcome home",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a lone figure standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking a vast, open landscape. The sky is filled with stars, symbolizing hope and possibility. The figure's heart is made of fragile glass, representing vulnerability, while their mind is depicted as a solid stone, signifying strength and resilience. Tear marks are etched on their face, revealing the pain they have endured. It is a bittersweet homecoming, filled with both longing and acceptance.",
