  "lyrics": "よ！ じゃぁ 行こうぞ！ ジャンケンポン！\n\nThey tell me, \"Keep it simple\", I tell them, \"Take it slow\"\n\nI feed and water an idea so I let it grow\nI tell them, \"Take it easy\", they laugh and tell me, \"No\"\nIt′s cool but I don't see them laughing at my money though\nThey spitting facts at me, I′m spitting tracks, catch me?\nI'm spinning gold out my records, know you can't combat me\n\nThey tell me, \"Jesus walks\", I tell them, \"Money talks\"\nBling got me chill, ′cause I′m living in an icebox\nThey tell me I've been sleeping, I say, \"I′m wide awake\"\nTracks hot and ready so they call me Mister Easy-Bake\nThey say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank\nDrivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank\n\nDo you feel me? Take a look inside my brain\nThe people always different but it always feels the same\nThat′s the real me, pop the champagne\nThe haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin′ at the pain\n\nStayin' still, eyes closed\nLet the world just pass me by\nPain pills, nice clothes\nIf I fall, I think I'll fly\nTouch me, Midas\nMake me part of your design\nNone to guide us\nI feel fear for the very last time\n\nThey tell me that I′m special, I smile and shake my head\nI′ll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said\nThey tell me I'm so humble, I say, \"I′m turning red\"\nThey let me lie to them and don't feel like they′ve been misled\nThey give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?\nServed on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me\n\nThey tell me I′m a god, I'm lost in the facade\nSix-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feeling odd\nNo matter what I make, they never see mistakes\nMakin′ so much bread, I don′t care that they're just being fake\nThey tell me they′re below me, I act like I'm above\nThe people blend together but I would be lost without their love\n\nCan you heal me? Have I gained too much?\nWhen you become untouchable, you′re unable to touch\nIs there a real me? Pop the champagne\nIt hurts me just to think and I don't do pain\n\nStayin′ still, eyes closed\nLet the world just pass me by\nPain pills, nice clothes\nIf I fall, I think I'll fly\nTouch me, Midas\nMake me part of your design\nNone to guide us\nI feel fear for the very last time\n\nLay still, restless\nLosing sleep while I lose my mind\nAll thrill, no stress\nAll my muses left behind (left behind)\nWorld is below\nSo high up, I'm near-divine (I′m so high up)\nLean in, let go\nI feel fear for the very last time",
