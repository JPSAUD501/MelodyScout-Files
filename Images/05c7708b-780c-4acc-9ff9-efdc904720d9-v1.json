  "lyrics": "Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe\n\nCan't think, can't...\n\nEverything gettin' harder to find\nEverybody jumpin' out of they mind\nEverybody going out of they skins\nSee we get to the end, but that's where we begin, you feel it\nMannequins say \"We breakin' the mold\"\nBreakin' out and we breakin' the codes\nSimilar to the Jacques Cousteau\nTo the depths and you're wet, so your tank explodes, so get it out\nSend your body to flight\nEverybody got a target tonight\nEverybody come along for the ride\nAll you studs and you duds and you ladies, let's fly\nGrip the moment like you grippin' the earth\nFeel the weight and you feelin' the girth\nNow you get it, now you feelin' your worth\nFeel the sound you used to make when everything thing used to hurt, it goes\n\nOh, no time to rest\nJust do your best\nOh, what you hear is not a test\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you go\n\nGotta go, gotta make it in time\nBrightest star gonna be the guide\nGotta get you to the other side\nTo where the butterflies and where the peach reside\nThe first five minutes for the fifteen of fame\nFive seconds 'fore you're saying my name\nI'm deadly sharpshooting the game\nGonna hit you and this whole execution is aim\nGet together and we building a fire\nClear smoke and it's taking us higher\nHands up, everyone is one\nIf you see yourself making it, you're seeing the sun\nMetropolis on the edge of control\nThey take our money, but they won't take our soul\nFuck that, ain't gon' do it no mo'\nWon't do what we told and we ain't gonna fold, we go\n\nOh, no time to rest\nJust do your best\nOh, what you hear is not a test\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you go\n\nGo, go, go\n\nGo, go, go\n\nCan't think, can't sleep, can't breathe\nCan't think, can't sleep, can't breathe\nEverybody jumpin' out of they mind\nEverybody going out of they skins\nEverybody jumpin' out of they mind\nEverybody going out of they skins\n\nOh, no time to rest\nJust do your best\nOh, what you hear is not a test\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you\nWe're only here to make you go",
