  "imageDescription": "A broken dollhouse, with cracked walls and shattered furniture. The dolls inside wear plastic smiles, hiding their true emotions. Outside, a perfect family portrait hangs on the wall, contrasting the chaos inside. The image symbolizes the facade of perfection maintained by the family, while the reality remains hidden behind closed doors.",
