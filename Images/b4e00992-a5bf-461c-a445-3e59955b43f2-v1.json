  "lyrics": "Ooh, let′s go\n\nSteve walks warily down the street\n\nWith the brim pulled way down low\nAin't no sound but the sound of his feet\nMachine guns ready to go\n\nAre you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?\nAre you hanging on the edge of your seat?\nOut of the doorway, the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat, yeah\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust\nHey, I′m gonna get you too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nHow do you think I'm going to get along?\nWithout you, when you're gone\nYou took me for everything that I had\nAnd kicked me out on my own\n\nAre you happy, are you satisfied?\nHow long can you stand the heat?\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat, look out\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust\nHey, I′m gonna get you too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nHey\n\nOh, take it\nBite the dust\nBite the dust\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust, ow\nAnother one bites the dust, hey, hey\nAnother one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh\n\nOoh, shoot out\n\nThere are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man\nAnd bring him to the ground\nYou can beat him, you can cheat him\nYou can treat him bad and leave him when he′s down, yeah\n\nBut I'm ready, yes, I′m ready for you\nI'm standing on my own two feet\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nRepeating to the sound of the beat, oh, yeah\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust (yeah)\nHey, I′m gonna get you too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nShoot out\nAy-yeah\nAlright",
  "imageDescription": "The image is of a silhouette of a man walking confidently down a dark street. His hat is pulled low, and he is carrying a machine gun. The street is empty, and the only sound is the rhythmic beat of his footsteps. The image captures the intensity and anticipation of the song, as the man prepares for a showdown.",
