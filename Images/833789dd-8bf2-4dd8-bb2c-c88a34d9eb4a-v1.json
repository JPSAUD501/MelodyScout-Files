  "imageDescription": "A couple sitting on the edge of a rooftop, smoking cigarettes and looking out at the night sky. The sky is a deep blue, and the stars are twinkling. The city lights are spread out below them, like a glittering sea. The couple is silhouetted against the skyline, and they look very much in love.",
