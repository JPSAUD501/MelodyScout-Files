  "lyrics": "You speak to me\nAnd in your words I hear a melody\nBut in the twilight it's so hard to see\nWhat's wrong for me\n\nI can't resist\nUntil you give the truth a little twist\nAs if you're gonna get away with this\nYou're not sorry\n\nI can't believe I fell for this\n\nI fell through the hole\nDown at the bottom of your soul\nDidn't think you could go\nSo low\nLook at what you've done\nYou're losing me\nHere's what you've won\nGot me planning to go\nSolo\nSolo\n\nYou sing to me\nToo bad you couldn't even stay on key\nIf your life is such a mystery\nWhy don't you just stick to acting?\n\nOh, here you go again (Go again)\nYou couldn't find my number until when (Until when)\nYou thought that you could get to my best friend\nWithout a script your game is lacking\n\nI can't believe I fell for this\n\nI fell through the hole\nDown at the bottom of your soul\nDidn't think you could go\nSo low\nLook at what you've done\nYou're losing me\nHere's what you've won\nGot me planning to go\nSolo\nSolo\n\nI'd rather go out to a party alone\nThan have to walk around with you on my arm\nNow that I'm proud to admit that we're done\nGood luck trying to find me, oh\n\n'Cause I didn't think you could go\nSo low\nLook at what you've done\nYou're losing me\nHere's what you've won\nGot me planning to go\nSolo\n\nNow we're done\n'Cause you got me planning to go\nSolo\nSolo\nSolo\nSolo",
