  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool\nAnd when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older\nBut fuck it, it was something to do\nI'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove\nI'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars\nAnd I spend it on girls and shoes\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you don't wanna be high like me\nNever really knowing why like me\nYou don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone\nYou don't wanna ride the bus like this\nNever knowing who to trust like this\nYou don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing\nStuck up on that stage singing\nAll I know are sad songs, sad songs\nDarling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs\n\n[Drop]\nI-I know are sad songs\nI-I know are sad songs\nI-I know are sad songs\nI-I know are sad songs\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm just a singer who already blew his shot\nI get along with old timers\n'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot\nAnd I can't keep a girl, no\n'Cause as soon as the sun comes up\nI cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse\nBut the truth is I can't open up\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you don't wanna be high like me\nNever really knowing why like me\nYou don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone\nYou don't wanna ride the bus like this\nNever knowing who to trust like this\nYou don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing\nStuck up on that stage singing\nAll I know are sad songs, sad songs\nDarling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs\n\n[Drop]\nI-I know are sad songs\nI-I know are sad songs\nSad songs\nI-I know are sad songs\nSad songs\nI-I know are sad songs",

  "imageDescription": "A lone figure stands on a stage, microphone in hand, spotlight illuminating their face. Behind them, a roller coaster twists and turns, representing the ups and downs of fame. The figure looks weary, surrounded by a sea of empty seats. The image captures the melancholy and isolation of the song, symbolizing the longing for connection and the weight of past success."
