(ah-ah)\nI need something that′ll make me believe (ah-ah)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I′m not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nIf you're good enough, you'll find a way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change her ways\nDo you think about it night and day?\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n\nI come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me (ooh)\nI′m not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I′m not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nHoudini\n\nCatch me or I go Houdini",
  "imageDescription": "A floating red balloon, caught in a gust of wind, represents the fleeting nature of the song. The balloon symbolizes the singer, coming and going, as the wind represents the passing of time. The image captures the sense of elusive charm and the need to catch hold of something before it disappears, just like Houdini's magic tricks.",
