  "lyrics": "She was always dealing with the devil\nShe was always into taking those chances, yeah\nSaid she met a couple other women\nWho were into going late night dancing, yeah\n\nThen she fell in love with a pill\nThat could take away all her pain, yeah\nThen she fell in love with a whole new drug\nThat could fill her veins\nAnd then\n\nShe's high\nShe lives in the sky\nTonight, she's satisfied\nRolling back her eyes\nBut then she starts to cry\nEverything is turning to black\nAll in one night\nShe just went to heaven and back\n\nBoiling water\nDying in an empty corner\nTied to aluminium borders\nShe tried, but the obsidian caught her, yeah\n\nAnd it might seem like she's crazy\nBy the things that she might say, but\nWhile you're talking she shoots\nDiamorphine right into her veins\nAnd then\n\nShe's high\nShe lives in the sky\nTonight, she's satisfied\nRolling back her eyes\nBut then she starts to cry\nEverything is turning to black\nAll in one night\nShe just went to heaven and back\n\nYeah, ooh, yeah\nShe went to heaven and back\nOoh, yeah\nShe went to heaven and back\nNow everything is turning to black\nAll in one night\nShe just went to heaven and back\n\nHeaven and back\nHeaven and back\nHeaven and back\n\nWell, you lied\nYou said you were fine\nBut now you're terrified\nSay you don't wanna die\nThen you start to cry\nYou wish that you could take it all back\n'Cause you just went to heaven and back\n\nShe's high\nShe lives in the sky\nTonight, she's satisfied\nRolling back her eyes\nBut then she starts to cry\nEverything is turning to black\nAll in one night\nShe just went to heaven and back\n\nYeah, ooh, yeah\nShe went to heaven and back\nOoh, yeah\nShe went to heaven and back\nNow everything is turning to black\nAll in one night\nShe just went to heaven and back",
  "imageDescription": "A woman lying on a bed of thorns, surrounded by pills. She is wearing a white dress and has long, flowing hair. Her eyes are closed and her face is pale. The thorns are piercing her skin, and blood is dripping down her body. The woman is surrounded by a dark, shadowy aura.",
