  "lyrics": "Sky blue eyes\nI see a world behind them\nNo more time\n\nSinking into the silence\n\nReaching out for something\nYou may never find\nLooking for a reason\nNot to lose your mind\n\nFeel like you′re caught in a world you don't belong to\nPraying that you′ll make it home\nI know you're scared that the place you love is gone\nDon't fear what you do not know\n\nNeon signs\nFlicker away forever\nCross state lines\nWe could be lost together\n\nReaching out for something\nYou may never find\nLooking for a reason\nNot to lose your mind\n\nFeel like you′re caught in a world you don′t belong to\nPraying that you'll make it home\nI know you′re scared that the place you love is gone\nDon't fear what you do not know\n\nFeel like you′re caught in a world you don't belong to\nPraying that you′ll make it home\nI know you're scared that the place you love is gone\nDon't fear what you do not know",
  "imageDescription": "A lone figure stands on a desolate highway, the sky above them a vibrant blue. Neon signs flicker in the distance, hinting at a forgotten city. The figure reaches out, searching for something they may never find. Despite their fear, they press on, determined not to lose their mind.",
