  "lyrics": "[Produced by Fraser T. Smith]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI let it fall, my heart\nAnd as it fell, you rose to claim it\nIt was dark, and I was over\nUntil you kissed my lips and you saved me\nMy hands, they were strong\nBut my knees were far too weak\nTo stand in your arms\nWithout falling to your feet\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut there's a side to you\nThat I never knew, never knew\nAll the things you'd say\nThey were never true, never true\nAnd the games you'd play\nYou would always win, always win\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name\nYour name\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I lay with you\nI could stay there, close my eyes\nFeel you here forever\nYou and me together, nothing is better\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause there's a side to you\nThat I never knew, never knew\nAll the things you'd say\nThey were never true, never true\nAnd the games you'd play\nYou would always win, always win\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name\nYour name\nI set fire to the rain\nAnd I threw us into the flames\nWhen we fell, somethin' died\n'Cause I knew that that was the last time\nThe last time\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes, I wake up by the door\nThat heart you caught must be waitin' for you\nEven now, when we're already over\nI can't help myself from lookin' for you\n\n[Chorus]\nI set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name\nYour name\nI set fire to the rain\nAnd I threw us into the flames\nWhen we fell, somethin' died\n'Cause I knew that that was the last time\nThe last time\n\n[Outro]\nOh\nOh, no\nLet it burn\nOh\nLet it burn\nLet it burn",
