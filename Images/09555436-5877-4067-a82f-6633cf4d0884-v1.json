  "imageDescription": "In the image, a bright neon sign that says \"love\" flickers against a dark city backdrop. A car is parked nearby, waiting to be started. The image captures the excitement and anticipation of a new love, with the neon sign symbolizing the highlight of the relationship. The simplicity of the image reflects the catchy and repetitive nature of the song.",
