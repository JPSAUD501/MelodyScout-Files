  "lyrics": "I′m tired of being what you want me to be\nFeeling so faithless, lost under the surface\nDon't know what you′re expecting of me\n\nPut under the pressure of walking in your shoes\n\n(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you\n(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)\n\nI've become so numb\nI can't feel you there\nBecome so tired\nSo much more aware\nI′m becoming this\nAll I want to do\nIs be more like me\nAnd be less like you\n\nCan′t you see that you're smothering me\nHolding too tightly, afraid to lose control?\n′Cause everything that you thought I would be\nHas fallen apart right in front of you\n\n(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you\n(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)\nAnd every second I waste is more than I can take\n\nI've become so numb\nI can′t feel you there\nBecome so tired\nSo much more aware\nI'm becoming this\nAll I want to do\nIs be more like me\nAnd be less like you\n\nAnd I know\nI may end up failing too\nBut I know\nYou were just like me with someone disappointed in you\n\nI′ve become so numb\nI can't feel you there\nBecome so tired\nSo much more aware\nI'm becoming this\nAll I want to do\nIs be more like me\nAnd be less like you\n\nI′ve become so numb\nI can′t feel you there\n(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)\nI′ve become so numb\nI can't feel you there\n(I′m tired of being what you want me to be)",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents this song is a person standing in a crowd, surrounded by a sea of faceless, indistinguishable individuals. The person's face is blurred or fading away, symbolizing their loss of identity and feeling numb. The crowd represents the pressure to conform and be someone they are not, while the fading face represents the desire to break free and be true to oneself.",
