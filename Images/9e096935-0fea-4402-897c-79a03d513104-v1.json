  "imageDescription": "An image of a burning house, with flames reaching high into the night sky. The silhouette of a person standing in front of the house, their arms outstretched as if trying to hold onto something. The intensity of the fire contrasts with the darkness of the night, symbolizing the struggle to hold on and stay strong in the face of destruction.",
