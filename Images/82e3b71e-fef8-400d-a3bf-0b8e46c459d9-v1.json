  "imageDescription": "In the image, a person stands in a dark room, surrounded by colorful, swirling lights that resemble stars. The lights reflect in the person's eyes, giving them a dreamy and mesmerized expression. The person's outstretched hand is reaching towards the lights, as if trying to grasp them. The overall effect is a sense of enchantment and the feeling of being lost in a hallucination.",
