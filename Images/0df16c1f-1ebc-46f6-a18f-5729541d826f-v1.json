  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nParading to the masses, we're coming so fresh to death\nI've been stealing looks from shadows, you conjure with your purse\nYeah, you're walking in stilettos but your nose is bleeding out\nI've been running from the devil but the devil's on my back\nI'm decreasing, took a leave of absence from the war\nIf the wall is coming down, then we got to press the pedal\nGot my hands up in the air, I'm saying I can't breathe\nI got my hands up in the air, I'm saying\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHey man, get away from me\nYeah\nHey man, get away from me\nUh\nYeah, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nNever ask for any favors, there's nothing I want from you\nI've been looking for an answer to keep me from fallin' through\nAnd I'm waiting for the voice to speak 'cause I can't see\nI hope we'll hear the sound eventually\n\n[Verse 2]\nI felt their claws obstruct and refuse refugees in the new Rome\nLock our voices in the oven like S-Sylvia at home\nMy eyes are on the world\nYeah, my hands anxious to feel something real\nTrue colors tend to glisten and then reveal\n\n[Interlude]\nWhere's the love?\nMmm\nAnd why are we so far from love?\n\n[Verse 3]\nChased by badges, duckin' lights, push the dagger when it's right\nMartial law, inshallah, mi casa es tuya\nGhosting like I'm Daniel Johnston and I'm locked up in the basement\nWhere Satan lies in satin tweets and realigns his face lift\nThe criminals are laughing with their empty, toothless faces\nWe've melted all our gold to recommence our idol worship\nWe all pretend one day we'll be the greatest of the Gatsbys\nGrowling mouths with rabies and loyal like Sid and Nancy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHey man, get away from me\nYou pretend you got control\nHey man, get away from me\n\n[Chorus]\nNever ask for any favors, there's nothing I want from you\nI've been praying for an answer to keep me from fallin' through\nYeah\nYeah, I'm waiting for the voice to speak 'cause I can't see\nOh, we'll hear the sound eventually, yeah\nWe'll hear the sound, we'll hear the sound eventually",
  "imageDescription": "A group of people protesting in the streets. The people are holding signs that say \"Get away from me\" and \"We'll hear the sound eventually\". The people are wearing masks and their faces are covered in blood. The background is a dark red, and the only light comes from the streetlights.",
