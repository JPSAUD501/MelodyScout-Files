  "lyrics": "Down in the gutter and looking for trouble\nOr something to that effect\nAnd there she was, a metal cross\nIronically 'round the neck\nAnd then she kissed me on the lips\nAnd a fever came without a warning\n\nSaid give me a holla\nAnd then I will follow you down into the dark\nAnd I was left in the depths\nSurrounding her feral heart\nOh, there's just something about the sun\nThat seems so very, very boring\n\nWhat did you think when you made me this way?\nWhat did you think when you love me this way?\nHold me so close when we get to the gates\nAnd we'll be together forever and ever and more\n\nIf you desire then you be my fire and I'll be your gasoline\nI'm getting sick of all the kicks this city is selling me\nAnd she said: \"Hey, let's get away and I'll be your new religion, baby\"\n\nWhat did you think when you made me this way?\nWhat did you think when you love me this way?\nHold me so close when we get to the gates\nAnd we'll be together forever and ever and more\n\nHold me close\nMy little Draculove\nWrap your arms around me\nMy Draculove\n\nMy Draculove\n\nWhat did you think when you made me this way?\nWhat did you think when you love me this way?\nHold me so close when we get to the gates\nAnd we'll be together forever and ever and more",
  "imageDescription": "A simple and creative image that represents the song \"Draculove\" is a silhouette of a couple standing on the edge of a cemetery at dusk, with the full moon shining above them. The woman has a metal cross necklace around her neck, and they are holding hands, symbolizing their eternal love. The image captures the dark and passionate essence of the song.",
