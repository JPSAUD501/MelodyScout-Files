  "lyrics": "I remember we were somewhere in your car\nYeah, I fell fast when you stole my heart\nThat long hot summer that I can′t forget\n\nI was hanging off every single word you said\n\nHad summer on the speakers out on the road\nA little KU on the radio\nHands out the window, sun sinking low\nSinging \"Raise 'em up\" baby, woah\n\nI know most days go by\nIt wasn′t wasted time\nHad a little bit of everything\nMaking memories of you and me\nGive back when we were us\nOnce in a lifetime love\nCan't help but think of you\nHope you think of me\nWhen you play that Keith\nWhen you play that Keith\n\nEvery kiss the perfect melody\nWe went zero to crazy baby on repeat\nStuck in my head just like my favourite song\nYeah, never knew something so good could last so long\n\nI know most days go by\nIt wasn't wasted time\nHad a little bit of everything\nMaking memories of you and me\nGive back when we were us\nOnce in a lifetime love\nCan′t help but think of you\nHope you think of me\nWhen you play that Keith\nTurn it up, turn it up now\nTurn it up, turn it up loud\nHope you think of me like I think of you\nWhen you play that Keith\n\nHad summer on the speakers out on the road\nA little KU on the radio\nHands out the window, sun sinking low\nSinging \"Raise ′em up\" baby, woah\n\nI know those days go by\nIt wasn't wasted time\nHad a little bit of everything\nAnd you said that I looked good in your shirt\nYeah, back when we were us\nOnce in a lifetime love\nCan′t help but think of you\nHope you think of me\nWhen you play that Keith\nTurn it up, turn it up now\nTurn it up, turn it up loud\nHope you think of me like I think of you\nWhen you play that Keith\n\nBack when somebody like you loved somebody like me\nYeah, it sure feels good, baby\nTo play that Keith",
  "imageDescription": "A car driving down a country road at sunset, with the windows rolled down and a warm breeze blowing through. The image captures the feeling of freedom and nostalgia, as the lyrics mention a long hot summer, hands out the window, and a Keith Urban song playing on the radio. It represents the simplicity and joy of young love and carefree days.",
