(Huh?)\nFind a lil′ spot, just sit and talk\nLooking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히\n보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream\n\nYou don′t even know my name, do you?\nYou don't even know my name, do you?\n누구보다도\n\nI′m super shy, super shy\nBut wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine\n떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time\nI wanna tell you but I′m super shy, super shy\n\nI'm super shy, super shy\nBut wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine\n떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time\nI wanna tell you but I′m super shy, super shy\n\n나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지?\nI don′t like that\nSomething odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it\nYou′re the top, babe\n\nI'm super shy, super shy\nBut wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine\n떨리는 지금도 you′re on my mind all the time\nI wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy\n\nI′m super shy, super shy\nBut wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine\n떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time\nI wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy\n\nYou don′t even know my name, do you?\nYou don′t even know my name, do you?\n누구보다도\n\nYou don't even know my name (super shy, super shy)\nDo you? (Make you mine, make you mine)\nYou don′t even know my name (you're on my mind all the time, I wanna tell you)\nDo you? (But I′m super shy, I'm super shy)",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song is a small, closed-up flower bud. The bud symbolizes the singer's shyness and hesitance to open up and reveal their feelings. The image captures the vulnerability and longing expressed in the lyrics, as the bud represents the singer's desire to bloom and make a connection with someone, despite their shyness.",
