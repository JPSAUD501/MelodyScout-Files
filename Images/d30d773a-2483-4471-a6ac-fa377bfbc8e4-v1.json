  "lyrics": "Had a dream where they shaved my head\nTop model, makeover stitch\nHeads up from the subconscious\nNew look, still I got upset\n\nGot a doctor on the interweb\nSay it means I need a safety net\nNew faces leaving me on read\nNew cities getting to my head\n\nCalling them incompetent 'cause I might need control\nRecovering perfectionist, I'm learning to let go\n\nI've got trust issues\nJumpin' out the plane without a parachute\nMicromanage up until I blow a fuse\nDon't like it when they tell me\nBut I know I do, I've got trust issues\n\nEverybody likes to give advice (calm down)\nOptimists are hard to fight\nTelling me how to live my life (my life)\nTake it chill, give it time\n\nBut I'm impatient, like to plan ahead (ahead)\nGotta be ten out of ten\nWhen I see it going out of line\nTell myself it's a waste of time\n\nCalling them incompetent 'cause I might need control\nRecovering perfectionist, I'm learning to let go\n\nI've got trust issues\nJumpin' out the plane without a parachute\nMicromanage up until I blow a fuse\nDon't like it when they tell me\nBut I know I do (I know I do)\nI've got trust issues (I know I do)\n\nI've got trust issues\n\nBut I know I do\nI've got trust issues",
  "imageDescription": "A woman with a freshly shaved head stands on the edge of an airplane door, a parachute unpacked at her feet. She's anxious, gripping her own arm, city lights blurring below. A chaotic montage of disapproving faces and control panels plays in the reflection of her wide, worried eyes. The style is surreal and edgy with vibrant, contrasting colors.",
