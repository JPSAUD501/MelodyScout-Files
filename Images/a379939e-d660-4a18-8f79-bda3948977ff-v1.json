  "lyrics": "I let it fall, my heart\nAnd as it fell, you rose to claim it\nIt was dark and I was over\n\nUntil you kissed my lips and you saved me\nMy hands, they were strong\nBut my knees were far too weak\nTo stand in your arms\nWithout falling to your feet\n\nBut there′s a side to you\nThat I never knew, never knew\nAll the things you'd say\nThey were never true, never true\nAnd the games you′d play\nYou would always win, always win\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nWhen laying with you\nI could stay there\nClose my eyes, feel you here forever\nYou and me together, nothing is better\n\n'Cause there′s a side to you\nThat I never knew, never knew\nAll the things you′d say\nThey were never true, never true\nAnd the games you'd play\nYou would always win, always win\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n′Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nI set fire to the rain\nAnd I threw us into the flames\nWhen we fell, something died\n'Cause I knew that that was the last time\nThe last time\n\nSometimes I wake up by the door\nThat heart you caught must be waiting for you\nEven now when we′re already over\nI can't help myself from looking for you\n\nI set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touch your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n′Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nI set fire to the rain\nAnd I threw us into the flames\nWhen we fell, something died\n'Cause I knew that that was the last time\nThe last time, oh\n\nOh, no\nLet it burn, oh-oh-oh\nLet it burn\nLet it burn",
