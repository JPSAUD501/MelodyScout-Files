  "imageDescription": "The image is a silhouette of a woman dancing in a dimly lit room. Her hands are raised above her head, and rays of light shine down on her. She is wearing a flowing dress, and her hair is wild and untamed. The atmosphere is both mysterious and empowering, capturing the essence of the song \"Bloody Mary\" by Lady Gaga.",
