  "lyrics": "I dreamt I slept on a sidewalk, but you still laid with me\nI dreamt I fell in a lion's den, and you still came for me\nI dreamt I lost all of my faith, and you still prayed for me\nWho the fuck cares about these plaques on my wall?\nYou're still the only thing I've done right\n\nWill you love me when my phone turns off?\nI don't want to be some digital Jesus\nNo more followers, we'll both get lost\nWhen it's me and you inside real life\nWill you love me when my phone turns off?\nI don't want to be some digital Jesus\nNo more followers, we'll both get lost\nWhen it's me and you inside real life\nI just want me and you inside real life\n(I just want me and you inside real life)\n\nThey'll say that I fell off, and it's alright\n(They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright)\nI'm so ready to run from the spotlight\n(So ready to run from the spotlight)\nThey'll say that I fell off, and it's alright\n(They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright)\nI'm so ready to run from the spotlight\n\nI dreamt I slept on a sidewalk, but you still laid with me\nWho the fuck cares about these?\nI dreamt I fell in a lion's den, and you still came for me\nWho the fuck cares about these?\nI dreamt I lost all of my faith, and you still prayed for me\nWho the fuck cares about these plaques on my wall?\nYou're still the only thing I've done right\n\nWill you love me when my phone turns off?\nI don't want to be some digital Jesus\nNo more followers, we'll both get lost\nWhen it's me and you inside real life\nWill you love me when my phone turns off?\nI don't want to be some digital Jesus\nNo more followers, we'll both get lost\nWhen it's me and you inside real life\nI just want me and you inside real life\n(I just want me and you inside real life)\n\nThey'll say that I fell off, and it's alright\nI'm so ready to run from the spotlight",
