  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song is a person peering through a small peephole in a door, with their eye visible. The person on the other side of the door is lying flat on the carpet, feeling panicked. This simple image captures the theme of obsession and the fear of being watched or pursued by someone who loves in strange ways.",
