  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been so distracted\nBy the way he looked at me\nOne look, I can't help it\nI gotta take my lead\nWhat if I walked over\nAnd said \"Hey, come with me?\"\nWhat if he gave me a number\nAnd said \"Why don't you call me?\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMesmerized, falling faster\nWaiting for his move\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got a good feeling\nThat we could be something\nI've got a good feeling\nBut am I thinking too far ahead?\nI've got a good feeling\nThat he'll change everything\nI've got a good feeling\nShould I just leave it all\nUnsaid\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe walked out the front door\nInto a diffеrent scene\nBallroom floor, vintagе clothes\nTake my waist, dance with me\nWhat if he leaned over\nAnd said \"You're all I need?\"\nWhat if I fell harder\nInto this one-step dream?\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got a good feeling\nThat we could be something\nI've got a good feeling\nBut am I thinking too far ahead?\nI've got a good feeling\nThat he'll change everything\nI've got a good feeling\nShould I just leave it all\nUnsaid\n\n[Bridge]\n(I know it sounds silly, dear)\nLukewarm dreams, Sunday dreams\nSpend my morning in empty scenes\nBlack and white, old movies\nDon't trust it, it's all a tease\nDon't trust it, it's all a tease\nDon't trust it, it's all a tease\nBut what if you're all I need?\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got a good feeling\nThat we could be something\nI've got a good feeling\nBut am I thinking too far ahead?\nI've got a good feeling\nThat he'll change everything\nI've got a good feeling\nMaybe I'll just go on ahead\n(You're all I need)\n(All I need, all I need)",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song is a person standing at a crossroads, contemplating two different paths. On one side of the path is a bright, vibrant ballroom scene with people dancing, representing the possibility of a new and exciting relationship. On the other side is a black and white movie theater, symbolizing the uncertainty and hesitation of trusting in love. The person's indecision is captured in their thoughtful expression and body language.",
