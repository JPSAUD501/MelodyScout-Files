  "lyrics": "Sky blue eyes\nI see a world behind them\nNo more time\nSinking into the silence\n\nReaching out for something\nYou may never find\nLooking for a reason\nNot to lose your mind\n\nFeel like you're caught in a world you don't belong to\nPraying that you'll make it home\nI know you're scared that the place you love is gone\nDon't fear what you do not know\n\nNeon signs\nFlicker away forever\nCross state lines\nWe could be lost together\n\nReaching out for something\nYou may never find\nLooking for a reason\nNot to lose your mind\n\nFeel like you're caught in a world you don't belong to\nPraying that you'll make it home\nI know you're scared that the place you love is gone\nDon't fear what you do not know\n\nFeel like you're caught in a world you don't belong to\nPraying that you'll make it home\nI know you're scared that the place you love is gone\nDon't fear what you do not know",
  "imageDescription": "A young traveler with sky blue eyes stares out of a car window. Neon signs blur past, reflecting in their eyes. A sense of longing and fear, of searching for belonging, permeates the scene. The style is dreamlike and melancholic, with a color palette of deep blues and vibrant neon pinks.",
