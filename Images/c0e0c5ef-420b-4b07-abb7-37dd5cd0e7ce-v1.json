  "lyrics": "I'm alone here on my island, floating in the sky\nI'm high above the world I used to know\nAnd I'm far from any danger, safe from any failure\nGuarded, I found shelter in the storm\n\nI'm hiding in the blue\nSafe between the clouds\nIn the blue\nWhere I can't be found\n\nWas a soldier in the legions, fought against the demons\nFought against the monsters made of gold\nBut they stormed across Arcadia, following their nature\nWashed away the place I once called home\n\nI'm hiding in the blue\nSafe between the clouds\nIn the blue\nWhere I can't be found\nI'm hiding in the blue\n\nI'm hiding in the blue\n\nAs time goes racing by, I'm wishing I could be fine\nBut I'm still so stuck on what used to be\nMade a prison out of my mind, watch life as it goes by\nBattle-scarred, my own worst enemy\n\nI'm hiding in the blue\nSafe between the clouds\nIn the blue\nWhere I can't be found\nI'm hiding in the blue\n\nI'm hiding in the blue\n\nHiding in the blue\n\nThe world's passing by, and I lost sense of time\nI've gone numb, I miss the days when we were making legends\nThe days come and go, I'll wait through sun and snow\nFor you to come and take me from this place and bring me home\n\nIn the blue\nSafe between the clouds\nIn the blue\nWhere I can't be found\nI'm hiding in the blue\n\nHiding in the blue\nIn the blue",
  "imageDescription": "A blue sky with a few white clouds. A small island floats in the sky, with a house on it. A bridge leads from the island to the clouds. A person is standing on the bridge, looking out at the sky.",
