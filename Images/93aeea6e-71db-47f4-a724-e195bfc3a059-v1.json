  "imageDescription": "The image is a dark and gritty carnival, with a towering ferris wheel and neon lights illuminating the night. In the center stands a fearless woman, dressed as a provocative and powerful ringmaster. She holds a bloody knife in one hand and a microphone in the other, commanding attention from the crowd. The atmosphere is chaotic and rebellious, mirroring the lyrics of the song.",
