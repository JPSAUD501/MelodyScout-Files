  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou hold me by the heart and you wear my soul\nLast week showed me I'm scared to be all alone\nI'm selling out to the dream, I'll be cool on my own\nI feel dead and a half, but you're making me laugh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou're the lucid, plain view Cupid found\nYou're the blueprint to my stupid sounds\n\n[Chorus]\nMy face feels hot and blue\nMy hands still count on you to let me down\nArticulate and lonely enough for the two of us\nIf you want, if you want, if you want to\nYou can call me on my phone, I'll run to you\nYou won't ever have to sleep alone\nYou can call me on my phone, I'll come to you\nYou won't ever have to sleep, sleep, sleep alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nLiving in the dark makes our light seem cold\nI distract myself awake, but in my dreams you're playing our song\nI'll tell my friends we made amends, tying up loose ends, they're not sold\nBut if you want it you can have it, you can have me in full\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou're the lucid, plain view Cupid found\nYou're the blueprint to my stupid sounds\n\n[Chorus]\nMy face feels hot and blue\nMy hands still count on you to let me down\nArticulate and lonely enough for the two of us\nIf you want, if you want, if you want to\nYou can call me on my phone, I'll run to you\nYou won't ever have to sleep alone\nYou can call me on my phone, I'll come to you\nYou won't ever have to sleep, sleep, sleep alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou're the lucid, plain view Cupid found\nYou're the blueprint to my stupid sounds\n\n[Chorus]\nMy face feels hot and blue\nWhen I'm alone with you\nLoneliness was built for two\nDo you want, do you want, do you want to\nYou can call me on my phone, I'll run to you\nYou won't ever have to sleep alone\nYou can call me on my phone, I'll come to you\nYou won't ever have to sleep, sleep, sleep alone\n\n[Outro]\nMy face feels hot and blue\nWhen I'm alone with you\nMy face feels hot and blue\nWhen I'm alone with you\nMy face feels hot and blue\nWhen I'm alone with you\nMy face feels hot and blue\nWhen I'm alone with you",
