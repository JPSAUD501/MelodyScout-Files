  "lyrics": "Telling myself I won't go there\nOh, but I know that I won't care\nTryna wash away all the blood I've spilt\nThis lust is a burden that we both share\nTwo sinners can't atone from a lone prayer\nSouls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt\n\nThere's darkness in the distance\nFrom the way that I've been livin'\nBut I know I can't resist it\n\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\nYou and I drink the poison from the same vine\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\nHidin' all of our sins from the daylight\nFrom the daylight, runnin' from the daylight\nFrom the daylight, runnin' from the daylight\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\n\nTellin' myself it's the last time\nCan you spare any mercy that you might find\nIf I'm down on my knees again?\nDeep down, way down, Lord, I try\nTry to follow your light, but it's night time\nPlease, don't leave me in the end\n\nThere's darkness in the distance\nI'm beggin' for forgiveness (ooh)\nBut I know I might resist it, oh\n\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\nYou and I drink the poison from the same vine\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\nHidin' all of our sins from the daylight\nFrom the daylight, runnin' from the daylight\nFrom the daylight, runnin' from the daylight\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\n\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\nYou and I drink the poison from the same vine\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time\nHidin' all of our sins from the daylight\nFrom the daylight, runnin' from the daylight\nFrom the daylight, runnin' from the daylight\nOh, I love it and I hate it at the same time",
  "imageDescription": "A dark and stormy night, with a single tree standing in the foreground. The tree is gnarled and twisted, and its branches are reaching out to the sky like claws. The leaves on the tree are all dead, and they are blowing in the wind. In the distance, there is a faint light, but it is quickly swallowed up by the darkness.",
