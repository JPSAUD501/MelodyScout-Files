  "lyrics": "People don't know much\nNeed a whiskey crush\nTo think of something new\nHey you watching me\nLookin' through a screen\nI'm here in front of you\n\nSometimes the days, they feel so long\nYeah, we all live under the same sun\n\nSo I hit my head up against the wall\nOver and over and over and over again, and again\n'Cause I don't wanna be like them\nI hit my head up against the wall\nOver and over and over and over again\nAnd again and again\n\nPeople piss you off\nSome you say you love\nThose you call a friend\nWalking through a crowd\nThen you look around\nSee there's no one left\n\nWe live and then we die as one\nYeah, we all live under the same sun\n\nSo I hit my head up against the wall\nOver and over and over and over again, and again\n'Cause I don't wanna be like them\nI hit my head up against the wall\nOver and over and over and over again\nAnd again and again\n\nI left my heart in Amsterdam\nWhere I could dream and nights were long\nI left my heart in Amsterdam\nI hit my head against the wall\nOver, over, over\nAgain and again and then over, over, over\nAgain and again and then over, over, over\nAgain and again and then over, over, over\n\nSo I hit my head up against the wall\nOver and over and over and over again, and again\n'Cause I don't wanna be like them\nI hit my head up against the wall\nOver and over and over and over again\nAnd again and again\n\nOh, I left my heart in Amsterdam\nI left my heart in Amsterdam\nOh, I left my heart in Amsterdam\nI really need that feeling back\nYeah",
  "imageDescription": "A simple and creative image that best represents the song is a person standing in front of a graffiti-covered wall, with colorful abstract shapes and words representing the frustrations and desires expressed in the lyrics. The person is seen repeatedly hitting their head against the wall, symbolizing the repetitive nature of their struggles and the need for change. The image captures the contrast between the vibrant and expressive art on the wall and the person's frustrations.",
