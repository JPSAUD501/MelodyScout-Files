  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents this song is a person wearing a mask, their eyes filled with sadness and desperation. The mask represents their attempt to hide their pain and the darkness within. Surrounding them are swirling shadows, representing the eternal madness and nightmares that haunt their mind. The image captures the feeling of being trapped in a cycle of sleeplessness and self-destructive behaviors.",
