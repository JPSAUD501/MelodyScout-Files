  "imageDescription": "A lone astronaut floats in a vast, starry sky, surrounded by swirling galaxies. In the background, a small hot tub filled with colorful lights and steam bubbles. The astronaut wears a tired expression, symbolizing the weight of loneliness and addiction. It's a juxtaposition of isolation and escapism, capturing the essence of the song.",
