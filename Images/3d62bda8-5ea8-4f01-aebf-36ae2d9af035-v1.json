  "lyrics": "Are you scared of spiders\nCreepin′ in your bed?\nSuffering the violent\n\nThoughts inside your head\n\nTalk about silence, and violence\nAnd deadmen, and spiders\nMonster under my bed\nCan't get them out of my head\nToo high, too low\nCan′t check behind my door\nNo more, no more\nI ain't afraid of no ghosts\n\nFifteen men on a deadman's chest\nSinking to the bottom of the sea\nI sail my boat on a sea of fears\nBut I won′t ever let ′em bother me\n\nWh-wh-what are you afraid of?\nWhen the nightmares come\nAnd the darkness kills the day\nTell me what you're scared of\nWhen you can′t wake up and your legs won't run away\nWh-wh-what are you afraid of?\nTell me what you′re scared of\nTell me what you're scared of (tell me what you′re made of)\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\nEvery night when I fall asleep\nMy mind plays tricks, and I wonder what it means\nWhen I'm pullin' out my teeth, I can barely breathe\nAnd the blood runs cold from my head to my feet\nSo I start to believe that I′m six feet deep\nLocked in a box, having psychopathic dreams\nNow I′m trapped in a web, wishing I was dead\nWith a noose around my neck\n\nTalk about silence, and violence\nAnd deadmen, and spiders\nMonster under my bed\nCan't get them out of my head\nToo high, too low\nCan′t check behind my door\nNo more, no more\nI ain't afraid of no ghosts\n\nFifteen men on a deadman′s chest\nSinking to the bottom of the sea\nI sail my boat on a sea of fears\nBut I won't ever let ′em bother me\n\nWh-wh-what are you afraid of?\nWhen the nightmares come\nAnd the darkness kills the day\nTell me what you're scared of\nWhen you can't wake up and your legs won′t run away\nWhat are you afraid of?\nTell me what you′re scared of\nTell me what you're scared of (tell me what you′re made of)\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\nLet me tell ya about a story, I was younger in my days\nWas a little boy, always running, was afraid\nEverybody thinking I was very, very strange\nTalking to myself, I remember what I'd say\nLet me tell ya about a story, I was younger in my days\nWas a little boy, always running, was afraid\nEverybody thinking I was very, very strange\nTalking to myself, I remember what I′d say\n\nFifteen men on a deadman's chest\nSinking to the bottom of the sea\nI sail my boat on a sea of fears\nBut I won′t ever let 'em bother me\n\nWh-wh-what are you afraid of?\nWhen the nightmares come\nAnd the darkness kills the day\nTell me what you're scared of\nWhen you can′t wake up and your legs won′t run away\nWhat are you afraid of?\nTell me what you're scared of\nTell me what you′re scared of\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\nWhen the nightmares come\nAnd the darkness kills the day\nWhen you can't wake up and your legs won′t run away\nTell me what you're scared of",

The child's face shows a mixture of fear and determination. Shadows of spiders crawl on the walls, symbolizing the fears and nightmares that haunt the child's mind.",
