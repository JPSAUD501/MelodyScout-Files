  "imageDescription": "The image is a person standing alone in the pouring rain, looking in through a foggy window at a cozy living room filled with warmth and laughter. The person is holding an umbrella, symbolizing their resilience and strength despite being on the outside. The contrast between the person's isolation and the joyful scene inside represents the feeling of being excluded or left out.",
