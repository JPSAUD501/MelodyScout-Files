  "lyrics": "I′m 24 now\nStill at my parents house\nThought I would have it figured out\n\nFriends getting married, one has a baby\nI barely recognize this town\n\nMama asked me what my plan is for the future\nBut I don't even know what′s going on for dinner\nI'm 24 now, thought I could finally settle down\n\nParties end before I'm drunk\nFriday night I′m tired as fuck\nI don′t know how I ended up like this\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed? (Missed, yeah)\n\nBirthday's here, I′m still depressed\nGot no friends, just lots of stress\nIt feels like yesterday when we were kids\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n'Cause I don′t know\n\nSleep till the sun's down, another breakdown\nFeels like the days are all the same\nNew type of anxious, school never taught this\nAnd what the fuck are taxes anyway?\n\nI tell myself I won′t be cynical and bitter\nAnd now I see it when I'm looking in the mirror\nI'm 24 now, wondering when I will be okay\n\nParties end before I′m drunk\nFriday night I′m tired as fuck\nI don't know how I ended up like this\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n\nBirthday′s here, I'm still depressed\nGot no friends, just lots of stress\nIt feels like yesterday when we were kids\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n′Cause I don't know\n\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh) ′cause I don't know\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh) 'cause I don′t know\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh) yeah\n\nCan someone tell me what the hell I missed?\n′Cause I don't know",
  "imageDescription": "Image: A young person sitting alone on a park bench, surrounded by empty swings and an empty playground. The sun is setting, casting a melancholic glow. The person's expression reflects a mixture of confusion, sadness, and longing as they stare off into the distance, searching for answers that seem just out of reach.",
