  "lyrics": "Been about three days and I'm comin' back\nI'm about four minutes from a heart attack\nAnd I think you make me a maniac\nBut you don't know, oh\nTwo years and we in between\nBut we both been here since we 17\nHere we go, fist fight in a limousine\nBut they don't know\n\nAnd we both hope there's something\nBut we bo-both keep fronting\nAnd it's a closed discussion\nAnd I'm thinking, \"Damn, if these walls could talk\" (oh-oh-oh)\n\nWell, they'd be like (oh-oh-oh)\n\"Shit is crazy, right?\" (Oh-oh-oh)\nI ain't your baby no more\n\nBeen about two weeks since you went away\nI'm about halfway through a Cabernet\nThere I go, I'm wastin' a Saturday\nSittin' at home\nTold my new roommate not to let you in\nBut you're so damn good with a bobby pin\nNow you gon' play me like a violin\nHittin' these notes\n\nAnd we both hope there's something\nBut we bo-both keep fronting\nAnd it's a closed discussion\nAnd I'm thinking, \"Damn, if these walls could talk\" (oh-oh-oh)\n\nWell, they'd be like (oh-oh-oh)\n\"Shit is crazy, right?\" (Oh-oh-oh)\nI ain't your baby no more (oh-oh-oh)\n\nHey! (Oh-oh-oh)\nNo more (oh-oh-oh)\nI ain't your baby no more",
