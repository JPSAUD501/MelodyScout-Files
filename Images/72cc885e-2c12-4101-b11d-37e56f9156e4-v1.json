  "lyrics": "Last night I had the strangest dream of all\nLast night I had the strangest dream of all\nLast night I had the strangest dream of all\nLast night I had the strangest dream of all\n\nWake up, good morning, my love's distorted\nBut what's important, my shirt's imported\nI pray for more shit, like that would help me\nTo feel more free, typical story\n\nThe world is free for now, I'm fucking freaking out\nMy 3D goggles sounds try to drown it out\nAnd endorse the truth and fuck the rest\nI only see my friends on stage so cut the check\nOr cut my neck with a brand new set of car keys\nDriving where no one can catch me\nNeed a place to breathe and the sun is setting\nSoundtrack to forgetting, depressed or count blessings\nI don't know, check my watch, one, two, testing\nTick Tock, I hope we last long, 4001\nEnough time to right my wrongs because I've wronged a lot\nKnowing that shit's the first step\nBut knowing that won't make letting you down hurt less, less\n(Right now, right now, right now, right now)\n\nWake up, good morning, my love's distorted\nBut what's important, my shirt's imported\nI pray for more shit, like that would help me\nTo feel more free, typical story\n\nAll I need is more time right now\nAll I need is more time right now\nAll I need is more time right now\nLast night I had the strangest dream of all",
  "imageDescription": "A person wearing 3D goggles, their face displaying a mix of excitement and anxiety. In the background, a clock is ticking, symbolizing the passing of time. The person is surrounded by imported shirts, symbolizing materialistic desires. Despite the chaos, there is a sense of longing for freedom and a hope for a better future.",
