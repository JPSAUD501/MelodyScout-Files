  "imageDescription": "A small girl is sitting on the floor, playing with a doll. The girl is dressed in a white dress, and her hair is pulled back into a ponytail. She has a big smile on her face, and she looks very happy. The doll is a small, porcelain doll, with long, blonde hair and a pink dress. The doll is sitting on the girl's lap, and the girl is holding its hands. The doll's eyes are closed, and it looks like it is sleeping.",
