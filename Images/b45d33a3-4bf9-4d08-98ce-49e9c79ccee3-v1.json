  "lyrics": "Violins like this make me feel crazy\nIt's nice to daydream about a daydream\nTo want the things I want\nWithout them fading\nWithout me hating you\n\nSo practice your passion on me\nGive me your 100 degrees\nI'll die off whenever you need\nAn afternoon just to breathe\nSoon everyone will be gone\nThey'll forget my albums, I\nHope you'll be here when it's done\nAnd I'm crying over it all, yeah\nAnd I'm crying over it all, yeah\n\nAnd all I think about is where you might be\nAnd when I'm swallowed down\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh, oh\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd all I think about\nIs where you might be\nAnd when I'm swallowed down\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh, oh\nI just say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nCherry Red's your touch\nA touch I'm failing to feel or feel enough\nTo love your safety\nWho? What? When? And why?\nAll drive me crazy\nPlease make me sane for you\n\nSo practice your passion on me\nGive me your 100 degrees\nI'll die off whenever you need\nAn afternoon just to breathe\nSoon everyone will be gone\nThey'll forget my albums, I \nHope you'll be here when it's done\nAnd I'm crying over it all, yeah\n\nAnd all I think about is where you might be\nAnd when I'm swallowed down\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh, oh\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd all I think about\nIs where you might be\nAnd when I'm swallowed down\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh, oh\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nI want the fireworks\nI want the softest words\nI want what you deserve\nAnd to unlearn my hurt\nI guess I've got the time to lose my mind\nAnother thousand times\nTo get it right\nIt's all I want and all I need\nAnd really, all I think about\n\nIs where you might be\nAnd when I'm swallowed down\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh, oh\nI'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a solitary figure standing in front of a vibrant sunset, with cherry red petals falling gently around them. The figure is looking up at the sky, lost in their thoughts, while the colors of the sunset reflect the emotions of the song - a mix of longing, yearning, and a desire for connection.",
