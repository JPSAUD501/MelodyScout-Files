  "lyrics": "Putting my defenses up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\n\nNever put my love out on the line\nNever said yes to the right guy\nNever had trouble getting what I want\nBut when it comes to you, I'm never good enough\nWhen I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll\nWon't wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball\n\nBut you make me wanna act like a girl\nPaint my nails and wear high heels\nYes, you make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand\n\nYou make me glow\nBut I cover up, won't let it show\nSo I'm putting my defenses up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\n\nNever break a sweat for the other guys\nWhen you come around, I get paralyzed\nAnd every time I try to be myself\nIt comes out wrong like a cry for help\nIt's just not fair, pain's more trouble than love is worth\nI gasp for air, it feels so good, but you know it hurts\n\nBut you make me wanna act like a girl\nPaint my nails and wear perfume for you\nMake me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand\n\nYou make me glow\nBut I cover up, won't let it show\nSo I'm putting my defenses up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\n\nThe feelings got lost in my lungs\nThey're burning, I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)\nAnd there's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)\nSo scared, I take off, and I run\nI'm flying too close to the sun\nAnd I burst into fla-fla-flames\n\nYou make me glow\nBut I cover up, won't let it show\nSo I'm putting my defenses up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack (heart attack)\nI think I'd have a heart attack-tack\nI think I'd have a heart attack (oh, I think I'd have a heart attack)\nI think I'd have a heart attack",
  "imageDescription": "A heart-shaped balloon floating in the sky, tangled in a web of barbed wire. The balloon represents vulnerability and love, while the barbed wire represents the protective walls the person builds to avoid getting hurt. The contrasting elements symbolize the internal struggle between wanting to open up and the fear of heartbreak.",
