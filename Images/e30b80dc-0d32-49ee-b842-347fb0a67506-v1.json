  "lyrics": "I've been hearing symphonies\nBefore, all I heard was silence\nA rhapsody for you and me\nAnd every melody is timeless\nLife was stringing me along\nThen you came and you cut me loose\nWas solo, singing on my own\nNow I can't find the key without you\n\nAnd now your song is on repeat\nAnd I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat\nAnd when you're gone, I feel incomplete\nSo, if you want the truth\n\nI just wanna be part of your symphony\nWill you hold me tight and not let go?\nSymphony\nLike a love song on the radio\nWill you hold me tight and not let go?\n\nI'm sorry if it's all too much\nEvery day you're here, I'm healing\nAnd I was runnin' out of luck\nI never thought I'd find this feeling\n'Cause I've been hearing symphonies\nBefore all I heard was silence\nA rhapsody for you and me\n(A rhapsody for you and me)\nAnd every melody is timeless\n\nAnd now your song is on repeat\nAnd I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat\nAnd when you're gone, I feel incomplete\nSo, if you want the truth\n\nI just wanna be part of your symphony\nWill you hold me tight and not let go?\nSymphony\nLike a love song on the radio\nWill you hold me tight and not let go?\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah\nAh ah, ah\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah\nAh ah, ah\n\nAnd now your song is on repeat\nAnd I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat\nAnd when you're gone, I feel incomplete\nSo, if you want the truth (oh)\n\nI just wanna be part of your symphony\nWill you hold me tight and not let go?\nSymphony\nLike a love song on the radio\nSymphony\nWill you hold me tight and not let go?\nSymphony\nLike a love song on the radio\nWill you hold me tight and not let go?",
