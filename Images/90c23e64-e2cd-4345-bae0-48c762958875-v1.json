  "lyrics": "We′re waiting every night to finally roam and invite\nNewcomers to play with us\nFor many years we've been all alone\n\nWe′re forced to be still\nAnd play the same songs we've known since that day\nAn imposter took our life away\nNow we're stuck here to decay\n\nPlease let us get in\nDon′t lock us away\nWe′re not like what you're thinking\nWe are poor little souls\nWho have lost all control\nAnd we′re forced here to take that role\n\nWe've been all alone\nStuck in our little zone since 1987\nJoin us, be our friend\nOr just be stuck and defend\nAfter all you only got\n\nFive Nights at Freddy′s\nIs this where you wanna be?\nI just don't get it\nWhy do you want to stay?\nFive Nights at Freddy′s\nIs this where you wanna be?\nI just don't get it\nWhy do you want to stay?\nFive Nights at Freddy's\n\nWe′re really quite surprised\nThat we get to see you another night\nYou should have looked for another job\nYou should have said to this place goodbye\n\nIt′s like there's so much more\nMaybe you′ve been in this place before\nWe remember a face like yours\nYou seemed acquainted with those doors\n\nPlease let us get in\nDon't lock us away\nWe′re not like what you're thinking\nWe are poor little souls\nWho have lost all control\nAnd we′re forced here to take that role\n\nWe've been all alone\nStuck in our little zone since 1987\nJoin us, be our friend\nOr just be stuck and defend\nAfter all you only got\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's\nIs this where you wanna be?\nI just don′t get it\nWhy do you want to stay?\nFive Nights at Freddy′s\nIs this where you wanna be?\nI just don't get it\nWhy do you want to stay?\nFive Nights at Freddy′s",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a worn-out animatronic bear with chipped paint and a faded smile, standing in front of a closed metal door. Its eyes are glowing in an eerie yellow, and there is a sense of loneliness and desperation in its posture. The dimly lit room behind it is filled with broken machinery and cobwebs, symbolizing years of abandonment and decay.",
