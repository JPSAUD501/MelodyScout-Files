  "imageDescription": "A dark and stormy sea, with waves crashing against a rocky shore. The sky is black, and the only light comes from the flashes of lightning. In the foreground, a group of people are struggling to stay afloat in the water. They are being battered by the waves, and some of them are already starting to sink. In the background, a large oil tanker is on fire, and black smoke is billowing into the sky.",
