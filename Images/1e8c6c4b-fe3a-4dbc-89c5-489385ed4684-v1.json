  "lyrics": "Hearing whispers in the night\nVoices filling up your mind\nYou're like a ghost of you\nYou've been drowning in the rain\nSlowly saving up the pain\nSo deep inside of you\n\nSee the colours of the sky\nSlowly turn from black and white\nA rising hope, bright as gold\nAnd now there's nothing left to lose\nSo we're breaking all the rules\nAnd they don't know what we know\n\n'Cause I can hear the thunder from afar\nA lightning in the dark\nI can feel the fire come alive\nSo calm before the storm\nSo dark before the dawn\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\nIn your eyes\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\nIn your eyes\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\n\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\n\nNow you'll never be the same\nOnce you've felt that burning flame\nYou're chasing stars alive\nWhat was broken's left behind\nWatch it crumble in the light\nNothing can stop you now\n\nSee the colours of the sky\nSlowly turn from black and white\nA rising hope, bright as gold\nAnd now there's nothing left to lose\nSo we're breaking all the rules\nAnd they don't know what we know\n\n'Cause I can hear the thunder from afar\nA lightning in the dark\nI can feel the fire come alive\nSo calm before the storm\nSo dark before the dawn\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\nIn your eyes\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\nIn your eyes\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\n\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\n\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\nIn your eyes\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes\nIn your eyes\nOh, I can see the fire in your eyes",
