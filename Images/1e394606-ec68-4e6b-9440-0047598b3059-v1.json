  "imageDescription": "A crowded, euphoric dance floor bathed in neon lights. A young woman throws her head back in laughter, arms outstretched, embracing the energy of the crowd. Confetti rains down as she dances, lost in the moment. Expressionistic style with vibrant colors and bold strokes conveying pure joy and liberation.",
