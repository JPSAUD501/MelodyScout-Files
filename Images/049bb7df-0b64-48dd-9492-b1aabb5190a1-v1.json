  "lyrics": "Oh, look at this place, what a waste, it's such a mess\nWe skim through the horror to find some happiness\nBut it's getting harder to get a little taste\nAs we're getting more divided every day\n\nOh, this feels like the end\nYeah, it feels like the end\nWe're addicted to the pain\nNo, we can't look away\nOh, this feels like the end\n(It won't stop)\nIs this ever gonna end?\n(Creeping on)\n'Cause I can't look away\n(It won't stop)\nNo, I can't look away\n\nCan you believe what we are seeing?\nWe devolve into inferior beings\nRight before your eyes, right before your eyes\nAnd I don't wanna see, wanna see\nWhat we've become\nWhat we've become\n\nNow we're getting numb to the numbers on the screen\nBut there's still more upturned dinghies in the sea\n\nOh, this feels like the end\nYeah, it feels like the end\nWe're addicted to the pain\nNo, we can't look away\nOh, this feels like the end\n(It won't stop)\nIs this ever gonna end?\n(Creeping on)\n'Cause I can't look away\n(It won't stop)\n\nCan you believe what we are seeing?\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nWe devolve into inferior beings\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nRight before your eyes, right before your eyes\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nAnd I don't wanna see, wanna see\nWhat we've become\n\nThere's a tension in the air\nEveryone can feel it\n(What we've become)\nSeven reported dead in the street, it permeates everything\nIt's in our homes, our chlorinated chicken\nSeventeen reported dead\nWe stare at whatever clickbait debate next goes viral\nPlastic opinions and drive thru funerals, everything has a price\nAnd then you\nYour consent is manufactured and you are being sold\nCategorized and catalogued\nPassed on and processed for whatever scheme is next designed\nTo keep us compartmentalized and at each other's goddamn throats\nFifty-seven reported dead\nWhere does it end? Is this it?\nAt what point do we say no?\nWe are people, surely we are better than this?\n\nCan you believe what we are seeing?\nWe devolve into inferior beings\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nRight before your eyes, right your eyes\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nAnd I don't wanna see, wanna see\nWhat we've become\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nWhat we've become\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nWhat we've become\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)\nWhat we've become\n(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)",
  "imageDescription": "A shattered mirror reflects the chaos of the world, with fragments representing different societal issues and conflicts. In the center, a person stands, eyes wide open, unable to look away from the destruction. The mirror's cracks symbolize the division and numbness felt by society. It serves as a reminder of the pain and desperation that surrounds us, urging us to confront what we've become.",
