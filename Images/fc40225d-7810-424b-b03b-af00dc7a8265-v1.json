  "lyrics": "And another one bites the dust\nOh, why can I not conquer love?\nAnd I might′ve thought that we were one\n\nWanted to fight this war without weapons\n\nAnd I wanted it, and I wanted it bad\nBut there were so many red flags\nNow another one bites the dust\nYeah, let's be clear I′ll trust no one\n\nYou did not break me\n\nI'm still fighting for peace\n\nI've got thick skin and an elastic heart\nBut your blade it might be too sharp\nI′m like a rubber band until you pull too hard\nI may snap and I move fast\nBut you won′t see me fall apart\n\n'Cause I′ve got an elastic heart\n\nI've got an elastic heart\nYeah, I′ve got an elastic heart\n\nAnd I will stay up through the night\nLet's be clear, won′t close my eyes\nAnd I know that I can survive\nI'll walk through fire to save my life\n\nAnd I want it, I want my life so bad\nI'm doing everything I can\nThen another one bites the dust\nIt′s hard to lose a chosen one\n\nYou did not break me\n\nI′m still fighting for peace\n\nI've got thick skin and an elastic heart\nBut your blade it might be too sharp\nI′m like a rubber band until you pull too hard\nI may snap and I move fast\nBut you won't see me fall apart\n′Cause I've got an elastic heart\n\nI′ve got thick skin and an elastic heart\nBut your blade it might be too sharp\nI'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard\nI may snap and I move fast\nBut you won't see me fall apart\n\n′Cause I′ve got an elastic heart\n\nI've got thick skin and an elastic heart\nBut your blade it might be too sharp\nI′m like a rubber band until you pull too hard\nAnd I may snap and I move fast\nBut you won't see me fall apart\n\n′Cause I've got an elastic heart\n\nI′ve got an elastic heart",
  "imageDescription": "An image of a heart made of rubber bands, stretched to its limits but still holding strong. The rubber bands are taut and vibrant, representing resilience and determination. Despite the sharpness of the blade cutting through, the heart remains intact, symbolizing the ability to withstand pain and keep fighting.",
