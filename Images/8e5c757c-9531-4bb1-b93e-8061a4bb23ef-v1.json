  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song is a broken heart made of shattered glass. The heart symbolizes love, while the shattered glass represents the betrayal and deceit described in the lyrics. The brokenness of the heart reflects the pain and confusion the narrator feels, as they desperately try to uncover the truth about their partner's infidelity.",
