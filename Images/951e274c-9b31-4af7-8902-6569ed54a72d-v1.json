  "lyrics": "Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so\nYou said your mother only smiled on her TV show\nYou′re only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope\n\nI hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old\n\nYou′re dripping like a saturated sunrise\nYou're spilling like an overflowing sink\nYou're ripped at every edge but you′re a masterpiece\nAnd now you′re tearing through the pages and the ink\n\nEverything is blue\nHis pills, his hands, his jeans\nAnd now I'm covered in the colors\nPulled apart at the seams\nAnd it′s blue\nAnd it's blue\n\nEverything is grey\nHis hair, his smoke, his dreams\nAnd now he′s so devoid of color\nHe don't know what it means\nAnd he′s blue\nAnd he's blue\n\nYou were a vision in the morning\nWhen the light came through\nI know I've only felt religion when I′ve lied with you\nYou said you′ll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too\nAnd I′m still waking every morning but it's not with you\n\nYou′re dripping like a saturated sunrise\nYou're spilling like an overflowing sink\nYou′re ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece\nAnd now you're tearing through the pages and the ink\n\nEverything is blue\nHis pills, his hands, his jeans\nAnd now I′m covered in the colors\nPulled apart at the seams\nAnd it′s blue\nAnd it's blue\n\nEverything is grey\nHis hair, his smoke, his dreams\nAnd now he′s so devoid of color\nHe don't know what it means\nAnd he′s blue\nAnd he's blue\n\nYou were red and you liked me ′cause I was blue\nBut you touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky\nAnd you decided purple just wasn't for you\n\nEverything is blue\nHis pills, his hands, his jeans\nAnd now I'm covered in the colors\nPulled apart at the seams\nAnd it′s blue\nAnd it′s blue\n\nEverything is grey\nHis hair, his smoke, his dreams\nAnd now he's so devoid of color\nHe don′t know what it means\nAnd he's blue\nAnd he′s blue\n\nEverything is blue\nEverything is blue\nEverything is blue\nEverything is blue",
