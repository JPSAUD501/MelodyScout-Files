  "imageDescription": "A burning church with stained glass depicting demonic figures, a chorus of hooded figures chanting \"all hail next gen\", an individual chained and surrounded by flames with a look of defiance, a chaotic mix of religious iconography and heavy metal imagery, dark and grotesque figures with hidden faces celebrating in the background.",
