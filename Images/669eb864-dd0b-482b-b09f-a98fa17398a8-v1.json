  "lyrics": "I've got demons, you've got scars\nBut all the bumps and bruises take us to the place we are\nWe've been through heaven and then we fell\nAnd you might think it's over\nBut the story's ours to tell\nJust know that I will be with you\n\nJust keep looking for the moon and I'll be here\nWhile you're searching for your life out in the dark\nLooking for the moon, you'll see it clear\n'Cause it shines the same wherever you are\nLet it guide you, don't look behind you\nIf you stay within the light, I'll always find you\nLooking for the moon, and I'll be here\nIf you don't ever have to feel alone\n'Cause I will be with you\n\nI will be with you\nKeep looking for the moon\nI will be with you\n\nIn my letters and in my songs\nIt's the thought of you that fills them up\nAnd keeps me feeling strong\nI don't regret it, I know it's hard\nBut I know that we are greater than the sum of our hearts\nJust know that I will be with you\n\nJust keep looking for the moon and I'll be here\nWhile you're searching for your life out in the dark\nLooking for the moon, you'll see it clear\n'Cause it shines the same wherever you are\nLet it guide you, don't look behind you\nIf you stay within the light, I'll always find you\nLooking for the moon, and I'll be here\n'Cause you don't ever have to feel alone\n'Cause I will be with you\nI will be with you\n\nAnd I know how it feels to be lonely and lie awake on your own\n(I will be with you)\nAnd I know how it hurts when you hide\nThat your heart is just holding on\n(I will be with you)\nBut if you think that I'll forget you\nThen you must be crazy\n'Cause honestly it's not only you that needs saving\nI will be with you\n\nJust keep looking for the moon and I'll be here\nWhile you're searching for your life out in the dark\nLooking for the moon, you'll see it clear\n'Cause it shines the same wherever you are\n\nKeep looking for the moon\nI will be with you (I will be with you)\nKeep looking for the moon\nI will be with you\n'Cause I will be with you",
