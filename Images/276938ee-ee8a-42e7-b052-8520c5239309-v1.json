  "lyrics": "Nobody knows how I got here\nNobody cared for my dream\nI get high off my lows\n\nAnd stronger from the blows\nSo I keep on, keep on, keep on\n\nAll of the pains\nTaste of the sweat and dirt\nWe all live for the day\nThey′ll be screaming our names\nSo we keep on, keep on, keep on\n\nWe're the new heroes\nWe′re the new heroes\nWe're the new heroes\nHeroes\n\nFought off the wolves in sheep clothing\nStood up for what I believed\nTurn my mess into messages\nLearned from the lessons\nAnd keep on, keep on, keep on\n\nThrough all of the fears\nTaste of the sweat and dirt\nWe all live for the day\nThey'll be screaming our names\nSo we keep on, keep on, keep on\n\nWe′re the new heroes\nWe′re the new heroes\nWe're the new heroes\nHeroes\n\nBurning through nights\nPaying the price\nTo be living legends\nAll of the breaks\nEvery stage\nTo be living legends\n\nWe′re the new heroes (the future)\nThe new heroes",
  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents this song is a lone figure standing on a mountaintop, with the sun setting behind them. They are facing forward, arms outstretched, as if embracing the challenges that brought them here. The figure exudes strength and determination, symbolizing the resilience and courage of the \"new heroes\" mentioned in the lyrics.",
