  "imageDescription": "A simple image that best represents the song could be a person standing in a crowded room, surrounded by faceless silhouettes. The person is looking directly at someone else, who is the only one they see. The contrast between the individual and the crowd symbolizes the longing for a specific person's attention, while the empty faces represent the unfulfilled desire for reciprocation.",
