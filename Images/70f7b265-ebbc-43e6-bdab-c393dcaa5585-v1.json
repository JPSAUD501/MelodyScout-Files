  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents the song is a person standing alone in a frozen tundra, surrounded by icy winds and snow-covered mountains. The person's body language exudes confusion and sadness, as they try to understand why their loved one has become so distant and cold. The icy landscape serves as a metaphor for the emotional distance and isolation they feel in the relationship.",
