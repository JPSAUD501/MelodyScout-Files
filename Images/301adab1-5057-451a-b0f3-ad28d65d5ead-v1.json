  "lyrics": "I need to keep you around, with my feet tied\nWith my feet tied tight to the ground\nThe end's nowhere to be found, I don't know why\nYou don't leave me to drown, oh, oh, oh\n\nDon't know where to go unless you say\nDon't know what to do unless you stay\nThinking that today will be our day\nBe our day again\n\nWhy am I playing with time as it's ticking away?\nIt's tickin' away, away, I'm asking\nWhy we run for our lives, not a second to waste?\nYou're tickin' away, away, away\n\nAlright, let's get it\nWinnin' (winnin'), losin' (losin'), either way I'm there\nGotta attitude, I'm out the roof up in the air\nThis round I make it count, yeah, I'm talkin' right now\nFeel like the comeback kid, I got no time to spare\n\nWoah, double up the score, turn a two to a four\nYou know I win a lot, gotta win one more\nOn a hot streak, never gets old\nSolo with the ace, and my team went gold\n\nWhy am I playing with time as it's ticking away?\nIt's tickin' away, away, I'm asking\nWhy we run for our lives, not a second to waste?\nYou're tickin' away, away, away\n\nYou're ticking away, away, away\n\nYou're ticking away, away\n\nI'll give it one more try\nI don't know why, but I keep coming back every time\nI want it more than my life\nI don't know why, but it feels so right\n\nWhy am I playing with time as it's ticking away?\nIt's tickin' away, away, I'm asking\nWhy we run for our lives, not a second to waste?\nIt's tickin' away, away, away\n\nIt's ticking away, away, away\n\nTicking away, away, away",
  "imageDescription": "A determined athlete with glowing eyes, bathed in bright stadium lights, triumphantly raising a trophy as confetti rains down. A surreal clock face melts behind them, time swirling and distorting, emphasizing the pressure and urgency of the game. Dynamic composition, gritty and energetic style.",
