  "lyrics": "Who's gonna stop us from waltzing\nBack into rekindled flames\nIf we know the steps anyway\nWe embroidered the memories\nOf the time I was away\nStitching \"We were just kids, babe\"\nI said, \"I don't mind. It takes time\"\nI thought I was better safe than starry-eyed\nI felt aglow like this\nNever before and never since\n\nIf you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary\nYou and I go from one kiss to gettin married\nStill alive killing time at the cemetery\nNever quite buried\nIn your suit and tie, in the nick of time\nYou lowdown boy, you standup guy\nYou Holy Ghost, you told me I'm\nThe love of your life\n\nYou said I'm the love of your life\nAbout a million times\n\nWho's gonna tell me the truth\nWhen you blew in with the winds of fate\nAnd told me I reformed you\nWhen your impressionist paintings of heaven\nTurned out to be fakes\nWell, you took me to hell, too\nAnd all at once, the ink bleeds\nA con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme\nBut I felt a hole like this\nNever before, and ever since\n\nIf you know it in one glimpse\nIt's legendary\nWhat we thought was for all time\nWas momentary\nStill alive killing time at the cemetery\nNever quite buried\nYou cinephile in black and white\nAll those plot twists and dynamite\nMr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry\nYou said I'm the love of your life\n\nYou talked me under the table\nTalking rings and talking cradles\nI wish I could un-recall\nHow we almost had it all\nDancing phantoms on the terrace\nAre they second-hand embarrassed\nThat I can't get out of bed\nCause something counterfeit's dead\nIt was legendary\nIt was momentary\nIt was unnecessary\nShould've let it stay buried\n\nOh what a valiant roar\nWhat a bland goodbye\nThe coward claimed he was a lion\nI'm combing through the braids of lies\n\"I'll never leave\"\n\"Never mind\"\nOur field of dreams, engulfed in fire\nYour arson's match, your somber eyes\nAnd I'll still see it until I die\nYou're the loss of my life",
