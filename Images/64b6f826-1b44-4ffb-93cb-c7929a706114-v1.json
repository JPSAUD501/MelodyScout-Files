  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been so distracted\nBy the way he looked at me\nOne look, I can't help it\nI gotta take my lead\nWhat if I walked over\nAnd said \"Hey, come with me?\"\nWhat if he gave me a number\nAnd said \"Why don't you call me?\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMesmerized, falling faster\nWaiting for his move\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got a good feeling\nThat we could be something\nI've got a good feeling\nBut am I thinking too far ahead?\nI've got a good feeling\nThat he'll change everything\nI've got a good feeling\nShould I just leave it all\nUnsaid\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe walked out the front door\nInto a diffеrent scene\nBallroom floor, vintagе clothes\nTake my waist, dance with me\nWhat if he leaned over\nAnd said \"You're all I need?\"\nWhat if I fell harder\nInto this one-step dream?\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got a good feeling\nThat we could be something\nI've got a good feeling\nBut am I thinking too far ahead?\nI've got a good feeling\nThat he'll change everything\nI've got a good feeling\nShould I just leave it all\nUnsaid\n\n[Bridge]\n(I know it sounds silly, dear)\nLukewarm dreams, Sunday dreams\nSpend my morning in empty scenes\nBlack and white, old movies\nDon't trust it, it's all a tease\nDon't trust it, it's all a tease\nDon't trust it, it's all a tease\nBut what if you're all I need?\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got a good feeling\nThat we could be something\nI've got a good feeling\nBut am I thinking too far ahead?\nI've got a good feeling\nThat he'll change everything\nI've got a good feeling\nMaybe I'll just go on ahead\n(You're all I need)\n(All I need, all I need)",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song \"Good Feeling\" is a person standing at a crossroads, with one path leading to a vibrant, colorful cityscape representing the potential of a new relationship, and the other path leading to a monochromatic, desolate landscape symbolizing the possibility of leaving feelings unsaid.",
