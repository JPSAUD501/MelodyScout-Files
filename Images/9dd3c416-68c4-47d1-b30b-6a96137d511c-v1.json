  "lyrics": "And all I am is a man\nI want the world in my hands\nI hate the beach\nBut I stand in California with my toes in the sand\nUse the sleeves of my sweater\nLet's have an adventure\nHead in the clouds but my gravity centered\nTouch my neck and I'll touch yours\nYou in those little high waisted shorts, oh\n\nOh, she knows what I think about\nAnd what I think about\nOne love, two mouths\nOne love, one house\nNo shirt, no blouse\nJust us, you find out\nNothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no\n'Cause it's too cold\nFor you here\nAnd now, so let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\nAnd if I may just take your breath away\nI don't mind if there's not much to say\nSometimes the silence guides a mind\nTo move to a place so far away\nThe goosebumps start to raise\nThe minute that my left hand meets your waist\nAnd then I watch your face\nPut my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah\nThese hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for\nInside this place is warm\nOutside it starts to pour\n\nComing down\nOne love, two mouths\nOne love, one house\nNo shirt, no blouse\nJust us, you find out\nNothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no\n'Cause it's too cold\nFor you here\nAnd now, so let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\n'Cause it's too cold\nFor you here\nAnd now, so let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa\n\n'Cause it's too cold\nFor you here\nAnd now, so let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\nIt's too cold\nFor you here\nAnd now, let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\nAnd it's too cold, it's too cold\nThe holes of my sweater",
  "imageDescription": "A young couple sitting on a bench in a park, holding hands. The man is wearing a sweater with holes in it, and the woman is wearing a tank top and shorts. The sky is cloudy, and the leaves on the trees are starting to turn fall colors.",
