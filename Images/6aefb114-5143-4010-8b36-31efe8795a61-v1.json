  "lyrics": "Let's sing a song full of hope, full of pain\nWhy don't you sing along my friend, for it's our last refrain\nForever young, ever strong, ever brave\nMemories like this never end, no, they don't fade away\n\nSo when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone\nI'll be right there, close to the sun\nKeep holdin' on, keep holdin' on\nAnd I'll be right there, close to the sun\nClose to the sun\n\nClose to the sun\n\nHere's to the one to let shine through the rain\nThe ones who stood for something more\nWe won't forget your names\nThe tide is high, say goodbye, we're settin' sail\nAnd all those midnight secrets told, we'll take 'em to the graves\n\nSo when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone\nI'll be right there, close to the sun\nKeep holdin' on, keep holdin' on\nAnd I'll be right there, close to the sun\nClose to the sun\n\nClose to the sun\n\nSo when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone\nI'll be right there, close to the sun\nKeep holdin' on, keep holdin' on\nAnd I'll be right there, close to the sun\nClose to the sun",
