  "lyrics": "Here we go, off the rails\nDon't you know it's time to raise our sails?\nIt's freedom like you never knew\n\nDon't need bags, or a pass\nSay the word, I'll be there in a flash\nYou could say my hat is off to you\n\nOh, we can zoom all the way to the moon\nFrom this great wide wacky world\nJump with me, grab coins with me, oh yeah!\n\nIt's time to jump up in the air, (Jump up in the air)\nJump up, don't be scared, (Jump up, don't be scared)\nJust jump up and your cares will soar away, (oohoohooh)\nAnd if the dark clouds start to swirl, (Dark clouds start to swirl)\nDon't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause\nI'll be your 1-Up Girl\n\nSo let's all jump up super high, (Jump up super high)\nHigh up in the sky, (High up in the sky)\nTherе's no power-up like dancing\nYou know that you're my Supеr Star, (You're my Super Star)\nNo one else can take me this far\nI'm flipping the switch\nGet ready for this, oh\nLet's do the Odyssey!\n\nOdyssey, ya see (x7)\nOdyssey, Odyssey!\n\nSpin the wheel, take a chance\nEvery journey starts a new romance\nA new world's calling out to you\n\nTake a turn, off the path\nFind a new addition to the cast\nYou know that any captain needs a crew\n\nTake it in stride as you move, side to side\nThey're just different points of view\nJump with me, grab coins with me, Oh yeah!\n\nCome on and jump up in the air, (Jump up in the air)\nJump without a care, (Jump without a care)\nJump up 'cause you know that I'll be there\nAnd if you find you're short on joy\nDon't fret, just don't forget that\nYou're still our 1-Up Boy\n\nSo go on, straighten up your cap, (Straighten up your cap)\nLet your toes begin to tap, (Toes begin to tap)\nThis rhythm is a power 'shroom (oohoohooh)\nDon't forget you're the Super Star (You're the Super Star)\nNo one else can make it this far\nPut a comb through that stache\nNow you've got panache, oh\nLet's do the Odyssey!\n\nIt's time to jump up in the air, (Jump up in the air)\nJump up, don't be scared, (Jump up don't be scared)\nJust jump up and your cares will soar away, (oohoohooh)\nAnd if the dark clouds start to swirl, (Dark clouds start to swirl)\nDon't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause\nI'll be your 1-Up Girl\n\nNow listen all you boys and girls, (All you boys and girls)\nAll around the world, (All around the world)\nDon't be afraid to get up and move\nYou know that we're all Super Stars, (We're all Super Stars)\nWe're the ones who've made it this far\nPut a smile on that face\nThere's no time to waste, oh\nLet's do the Odyssey!",
