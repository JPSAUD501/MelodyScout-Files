  "lyrics": "And all I am is a man\nI want the world in my hands\nI hate the beach but I stand\n\nIn California with my toes in the sand\nUse the sleeves of my sweater\nLet′s have an adventure\nHead in the clouds but my gravity's centered\nTouch my neck and I′ll touch yours\nYou in those little high-waisted shorts, oh\n\nShe knows what I think about\nAnd what I think about\nOne love, two mouths\nOne love, one house\nNo shirt, no blouse\nJust us, you find out\nNothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no\n\n'Cause it′s too cold\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\nAnd if I may just take your breath away\nI don′t mind if there's not much to say\nSometimes the silence guides our minds\nSo move to a place so far away\nThe goosebumps start to raise\nThe minute that my left hand meets your waist\nAnd then I watch your face\nPut my finger on your tongue\n′Cause you love to taste, yeah\n\nThese hearts adore\nEveryone the other beats hardest for\nInside this place is warm\nOutside it starts to pour\n\nComing down\nOne love, two mouths\nOne love, one house\nNo shirt, no blouse\nJust us, you find out\nNothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no\n\n′Cause it's too cold\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\n′Cause it's too cold\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater, whoa\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa\n\n'Cause it′s too cold\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\nIt′s too cold\nFor you here and now\nLet me hold\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n\nAnd it's too cold\nIt′s too cold\nThe holes of my sweater",
  "imageDescription": "A man and a woman stand in the rain, sheltered by a large, cozy sweater. They are holding each other close, their eyes closed, and their faces turned towards each other. The raindrops fall around them, but they are lost in their own world.",
