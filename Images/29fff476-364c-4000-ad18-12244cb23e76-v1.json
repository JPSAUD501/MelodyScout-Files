  "lyrics": "Just when I realized you've been shutting me out\nI start to reach for the sky\nAnd nothing's falling down\n\nOoh, everybody knows how the story goes\nBut fairy tales have been lying to me\nEvery time I try, you just run and hide\nNow I'm finally feeling free\n\nTell me, can you see me now\nWhile I rise above the crowd?\nWho would've known I'd make it out\nYour broken world, no\n\nYou thought you tore me down\nI'm not giving up now, you know\nSo tell me, can you see me now rising above?\nAnd nothing's stopping me now\n\nAnd nothing's stopping me now\n\nNothing's stopping me\n\nNow I know my feet\nThey won't fail me now\nSo thanks for showing me\nAll that I am about\n\nEverybody knows how the story goes\nBut fairy tales have been lying to me\nEvery time I try, you just run and hide\nNow I'm finally feeling free\n\nTell me, can you see me now\nWhile I rise above the crowd\nWho would've known I'd make it out\nYour broken world, no\n\nYou thought you tore me down\nI'm not giving up now, you know\nSo tell me, can you see me now rising above\nAnd nothing's stopping me now\n\nAnd nothing's stopping me now\n\nSo, can you see me now? Oh\nCan you see me now? Oh\n\nTell me, can you see me now\nWhile I rise above the crowd\nWho would've known I'd make it out\nYour broken world, no\n\nYou thought you tore me down\nI'm not giving up now, you know\nSo tell me, can you see me now, rising above?\nAnd nothing's stopping me now",
  "imageDescription": "A silhouette of a woman rising above a crowd of people. The woman is facing the viewer, and she is looking up at the sky. The sky is a bright blue, and there are clouds in the distance. The woman is wearing a flowing dress, and she has long, flowing hair. She is surrounded by a halo of light, and she looks like she is about to take flight.",
