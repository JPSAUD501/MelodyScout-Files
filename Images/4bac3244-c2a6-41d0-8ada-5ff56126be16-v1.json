  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHey girl, I'm in love with you\nBut the world doesn't want me to\nI'm not well, I am sick\nThe best kind of sick that one can get\nSo you can't believe a word they say\nAbout the person I am today\nIf all else fails, just think instead\nAt least you know I'm good in bed\nSo trace the lines of my tattoos\nWhisper that you love me too\nWe might as well, no matter what\nThey think I suck, but I don't give a fuck\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't hold your breath for me\nBut watching you turn blue would be comforting\nI told you once, I'll tell you twice\nI'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life, I'm bad at life\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey, girl, let's get out of here\nView the world in the rearview mirror\nJust me and you with nothing to lose\nElectric love and something to prove\nSo, please, take care of my hurt heart\n'Cause trusting you is the hardest part\nYou might as well, no matter what\nThey think I suck, but I don't give a fuck\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't hold your breath for me\nBut watching you turn blue would be comforting\nI told you once, I'll tell you twice\nI'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life\n\n[Bridge]\nAll your friends tell you I'm wrong\nBut all your friends sing this song\nAll your friends tell you I'm wrong\nBut all your friends sing this song, song\nAnd I don't give a fuck\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't hold your breath for me\nBut watching you turn blue would be comforting\nI told you once, I told you a million fucking times\nI'll give you bad advice because, I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life\n\n[Outro]\nI am bad at life, I am bad at life\nI am bad at life, I am bad at life\nI am bad at life, I am bad at life\nI'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life",
