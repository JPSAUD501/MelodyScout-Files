  "imageDescription": "A vibrant, colorful hourglass appears, filled with golden sand in the bottom half. The sand slowly trickles down, representing the passing of time. Above the hourglass, a majestic flame burns eternally, illuminating the scene. In the background, a silhouette of a person stands guard, their eyes fixed on the flame. The image portrays the concept of immortality and the idea of being a guardian of one's dreams and desires.",
