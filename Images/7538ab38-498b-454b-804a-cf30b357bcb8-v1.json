  "lyrics": "Maybe the world was made in six days\nBut I could ruin mine by Monday\nI'll write it on the wall\nIf you read this it's your fault\nIf all I'm here to do is relate\nMaybe I should try to live one normal day\nBecause it feels so, so far away\n\nYeah, you've been reading all about me\nAnd you're loving what you found\nI'm like American graffiti\nYou want some glitter, drink it down\nYeah, you've been seeing all about me\nTaking notes, yeah, write it down\nI'm like American graffiti\nIf you need me, I'm here now\nIf you need me, I'm here now\n\nNothing in this world can make me think straight\nSo I'm not leaving bed 'till Friday night\nI'll pack a suitcase\nFollow if you want\nAround the world 'till it stops\nI had therapy on Wednesdays\nBut haven't been in months\nSo here's an x-ray of what's in my brain\nSince it came unchained\nThe other day\nUsually, I'm all I've got\nLucky for me I don't need a lot\n\nYeah, you've been reading all about me\nAnd you're loving what you found\nI'm like American graffiti\nYou want some glitter, drink it down\nYeah, you've been seeing all about me (you've been seeing all about me)\nTaking notes, yeah, write it down\nI'm like American graffiti\nIf you need me, I'm here now\nIf you need me, I'm here now\n\nIf you need me, I'm here now\nIf you need me, I'm here now",
