  "lyrics": "I don't usually go all in, babe\nBut you're a hum that I had to play\nAnd you took me all the way\nMake me lose more than I could win, babe\nAnd I really need to let you know\n\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\nI'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care\nAnd I know you're thinking the worst of me\nBut I hope one day you'll see\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI don't usually overdose\nBut you're a drug that I had to take\nAnother fix, I couldn't wait\nNow the edge is far too close\nSo I really need to let you know\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you\n\nYou took me to a place so far from here\nYou took me to another atmosphere\nBut I got so high, I couldn't breathe\nAnd I've been holding, holding, holding, holding, holding, holding\n\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\nI'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care\nAnd I know you're thinking the worst of me\nBut I hope one day you'll see\nI'm not above love, I just ran out of it\n\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nAnd I only got myself to blame\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you\n\nI'm not gonna call you in\n'Cause you're taking everything\nYou keep robbing my heart like a bank\nNo thank you, no thank you",
  "imageDescription": "A piggy bank with a broken heart symbolizes the song \"Robbing My Heart Like a Bank.\" The piggy bank represents vulnerability and the heartbreak caused by someone taking advantage of the singer's emotions. The broken heart represents the damage done, while the empty coin slot represents the singer's depleted love. The image captures the theme of being used and left with nothing to give.",
