  "lyrics": "What did you mean when you said that you were sober now?\nCaught you in bed with a Red Bull vodka\nTwo weeks out\n\nNo one stops you\nNobody takes it from your hand\nEven when you break your leg, drunk, running\nSomeone ought to hold you to your words\nSay I love you and then drink it backwards\n\nWhat if it was all my fault?\nWhat if I drove you to it?\nI was only honest sometimes\nAnd I think you knew it\nMake a person out of memories\nThey won't live up to it\nI'm so sorry I stayed\nWhen I shouldn't\n\nNo one stops me\nNobody takes you from my hand\nEven (even) when you (when you) break your leg, drunk, running\nSomeone (someone) ought to (ought to) hold me to my words\nSay I love you and then drink it backwards\nSay I love you",
