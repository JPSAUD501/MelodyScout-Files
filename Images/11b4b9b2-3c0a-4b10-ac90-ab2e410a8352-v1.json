  "imageDescription": "The image that best represents this song is a broken snow globe, shattered into pieces on a dark, lonely night. The snow inside is frozen, representing the singer's heart being shut off from love. The broken snow globe signifies the shattered plans and dreams, while the darkness and solitude symbolize the emotional turmoil and isolation expressed in the lyrics.",
