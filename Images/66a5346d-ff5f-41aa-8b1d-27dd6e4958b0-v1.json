  "lyrics": "All the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nI let it fall, my heart\nAnd as it fell, you rose to claim it\nIt was dark and I was over\nUntil you kissed my lips and you saved me\n\nMy hands, they're strong\nBut my knees were far too weak\nTo stand in your arms\nWithout falling to your feet\n\nBut there's a side to you\nThat I never knew, never knew\nAll the things you'd say\nThey were never true, never true\nAnd the games you play\nYou would always win, always win\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nBut I set fire to the rain\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\nWell, it burned while I cried\n'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\nYour name\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nBut I set fire\n\nAll the things you'd say\n\nAll the things you'd say",
  "imageDescription": "The image is of a burning raindrop falling from a stormy sky, with flames engulfing it. The raindrop represents the tears shed from a broken heart, while the fire symbolizes the passion and intensity of the love that was once shared. It captures the conflicting emotions of pain and empowerment conveyed in the song.",
