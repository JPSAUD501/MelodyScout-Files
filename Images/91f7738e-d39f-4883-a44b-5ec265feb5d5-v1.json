  "lyrics": "I been up all night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\nAll night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\n\nSometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own\nI never seem to get it right, but I guess that's how it goes\nEver since you came around, can't nobody hold me down\nYou showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most\n\nI been up all night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\nAll night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\nWide awake, that's okay, as long as I'm with you\nI'll be up all night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\n\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\n\nI'm never gonna find my way\nIf I don't learn to let go\nThe past is the past, today is today\nAnd there's things I can't control\nThe circles underneath my eyes\nTell the truth that I've been tryna hide\nI've been waiting for you way too long\nWon't you come and take me home\n\nI been up all night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\nAll night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\nWide awake, that's okay, as long as I'm with you\nI'll be up all night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\n\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\n\nOh, I, I'm praying this ain't all a dream\nCan you, you, wake me up before you leave?\n\nI been up all night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\nAll night, no sleep\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming\nAs long as I'm with you\n'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming",
  "imageDescription": "A simple and creative image that best represents the song is a person lying in bed, their eyes wide open with circles underneath, surrounded by a swirling galaxy of dreams. The person is reaching out towards a figure, symbolizing the connection they long for. The image captures the feeling of being lost in dreams, yearning for someone to bring them back to reality.",
