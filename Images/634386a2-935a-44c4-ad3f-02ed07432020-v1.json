  "lyrics": "Diese kleine unheimliche Insel hat mich zu einer Waffe gemacht\nWir glauben beide-\n\n\nCette petite île étrange a fait de moi une arme\nNous croyons tous les deux que nous pouvons l′utiliser\nPour changer l'élan de cette guerre\n\nEsta pequeña isla misteriosa me ha convertido en un arma\nAmbos creemos que podemos usarla\nPara cambiar el impulso de esta guerra\n\nWelcome back to Trench\nWelcome back to Trench\n\nI created this world\nTo feel some control\nDestroy it if I want\nSo I sing, \"Sahlo\nFolina\nSahlo folina\"\n\nWait, what? Wait, what?\nWait, what? Wait, what?\n\nEarned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket\nBless your ear holes while you react, acting\nGobsmacked, don′t hesitate to maybe overcompensate\n\nI feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes\nDon't sleep on a boy who can′t fall asleep twice in the same night\nAnd won′t hesitate to maybe overcompensate\n\nI said, I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\nAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don′t hesitate to maybe overcompensate\n\nWhere I'm from, I was born right here, just now\nOriginated right in front of your eyes\nIf you can′t see, I am Clancy, prodigal son\nDone running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or alive\n\nSo now you pick who you serve, you bow to the masses\nGet kicked to the curb for passin' the classes\nHalf empty, half full, save half of your taxes\nThen overtake your former self\n\nI fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don′t hesitate to maybe overcompensate\nAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\n\nDays feel like a perfect length\nI don't need ′em any longer, but for goodness′ sake\nDo the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón?\nWay too short for my soul, corazón\n\nThe days feel like a perfect length\nI don't need them any longer, but for goodness′ sake\nDo the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón?\nWay too short for my soul, corazón\n\nEarned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket\nBless your ear holes while you react, acting\nGobsmacked, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\n\nI said, I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don′t hesitate to maybe overcompensate\nAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate",
