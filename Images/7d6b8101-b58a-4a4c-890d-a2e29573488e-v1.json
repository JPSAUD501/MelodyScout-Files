  "lyrics": "Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?\nCan I help you, not to hurt, anymore?\nWe saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep\nThere are things that we can have, but can't keep\n\nIf they say\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nIn the sky of a million stars\nIt flickers, flickers\nWho cares when someone's time runs out?\nIf a moment is all we are\nWe're quicker, quicker\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nWell I do\n\nThe reminders pull the floor from your feet\nIn the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh\nAnd you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair\nJust 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there\n\nIf they say\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nIn the sky of a million stars\nIt flickers, flickers\nWho cares when someone's time runs out?\nIf a moment is all we are\nWe're quicker, quicker\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nWell I do\n\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nIn the sky of a million stars\nIt flickers, flickers\nWho cares when someone's time runs out?\nIf a moment is all we are\nWe're quicker, quicker\nWho cares if one more light goes out?\nWell I do\n\nWell I do",
