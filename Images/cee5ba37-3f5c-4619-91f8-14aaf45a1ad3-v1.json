(ah-ah-ha)\nI need something that′ll make me believe (ah-ah-ha)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go, Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I′m not here for long)\nCatch me or I go, Houdini\n\nIf you're good enough, you'll find a way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change her ways\nDo you think about it night and day?\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n\nI come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me (ooh)\nI′m not here for long\nCatch me or I go, Houdini (ha-ha-ha-ha)\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I′m not here for long)\nCatch me or I go, Houdini\n\nHoudini\n\nCatch me or I go, Houdini",
  "imageDescription": "A simple image that represents the song \"Houdini\" is a colorful balloon floating in the air. Just like the balloon, the singer comes and goes, teasing the listener with their presence. The balloon symbolizes the fleeting nature of their presence, and the need to catch and hold onto them before they disappear like a Houdini.",
