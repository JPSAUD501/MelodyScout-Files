  "lyrics": "The smoke cloud billows out his mouth\nLike a freight train through a small town\nThe jokes that he told across the bar\nWere revolting and far too loud\n\nThey shake their heads saying, \"God, help her\"\nWhen I tell them he's my man\nBut your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger\nI can fix him, no, really I can\nAnd only I can\n\nThe dopamine races through his brain\nOn a six-lane Texas highway\nHis hand so calloused from his pistol\nSoftly traces hearts on my face\n\nAnd I could see it from a mile away\nA perfect case for my certain skillset\nHe had a halo of the highest grade\nHe just hadn't met me yet\n\nThey shake their heads saying, \"God, help her\"\nWhen I tell them he's my man\nBut your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger\nI can fix him, no, really I can\nAnd only I can\n\nGood boy, that's right\nCome close, I'll show you heaven\nIf you'll be an angel, all mine\nTrust me, I can handle me a dangerous man\nNo, really I can\n\nThey shook their heads saying, \"God, help her\"\nWhen I told them he's my man (I told them he's my man)\nBut your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger\nI can fix him, no, really I can (no, really I can)\nWhoa, maybe I can't",
