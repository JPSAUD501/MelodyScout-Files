  "lyrics": "Looking at me through your window\nBoy, you had your eye out for a little\n\"I'll cut you up and make you dinner\nYou've reached the end, you are the winner\"\n\nRolling down your tinted window\nDriving next to me real slow, he said\n\"Let me take you for a joyride\nI've got some candy for you inside\"\n\nRunning through the parking lot\nHe chased me and he wouldn't stop\nTag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\nGrabbed my hand, pushed me down\nTook the words right out my mouth\nTag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\nCan anybody hear me when I'm hidden underground?\nCan anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?\nSaying, \"Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\"\nHe's saying, \"Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\"\n\nLittle bit of poison in me\nI can taste your skin in my teeth\n\"I love it when I hear you breathing\nI hope to God you're never leaving\"\n\nRunning through the parking lot\nHe chased me and he wouldn't stop\nTag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\nGrabbed my hand, pushed me down\nTook the words right out my mouth\nTag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\nCan anybody hear me when I'm hidden underground?\nCan anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?\nSaying, \"Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\"\nHe's saying, \"Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\"\n\nEenie, meenie, miny, mo\nCatch your lady by her toes\nIf she screams, don't let her go\nEenie, meenie, miny, mo\nYour mother said to pick the very best girl\nAnd I am\n\nRunning through the parking lot\nHe chased me and he wouldn't stop\nTag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\nGrabbed my hand, pushed me down\nTook the words right out my mouth\nTag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it\nRunning through the parking lot\nHe chased me and he wouldn't stop\nTag, you're it, tag, you're it\nGrabbed my hand, pushed me down\nTake the words right out my mouth\nTag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it",
  "imageDescription": "A shadowy figure lurking outside a car window, their face obscured. The window is tinted, adding to the sense of mystery and danger. The image captures the theme of being pursued and the feeling of being trapped or captured, as depicted in the lyrics of the song.",
