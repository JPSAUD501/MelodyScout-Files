  "imageDescription": "The image is a black and white photograph split into two halves. On the left side, there's a shy, innocent-looking girl in a simple white dress, standing in a corner with her five best friends. On the right side, there's a confident, rebellious girl in a leather jacket, surrounded by boys who are mesmerized by her. The stark contrast represents the transformation from good girl to bad girl.",
