  "lyrics": "Don′t be that way, fall apart twice a day\nI just wish you could feel what you say\nShow, never tell, but I know you too well\n\nGot a mood that you wish you could sell\n\nIf teardrops could be bottled, there'd be swimming pools filled by models\nTold, \"A tight dress is what makes you a whore\"\nIf \"I love you\" was a promise, would you break it, if you′re honest?\nTell the mirror what you know she's heard before\nI don't wanna be you anymore\n\nHands getting cold, losing feeling is getting old\nWas I made from a broken mold?\nHurt, I can′t shake, we′ve made every mistake\nOnly you know the way that I break\n\nIf teardrops could be bottled, there'd be swimming pools filled by models\nTold, \"A tight dress is what makes you a whore\"\nIf \"I love you\" was a promise, would you break it, if you′re honest?\nTell the mirror what you know she's heard before\nI, I don′t wanna be you\nI don't wanna be you\nI don′t wanna be you anymore",
  "imageDescription": "The image is a shattered mirror reflecting a girl's face. Each shard of glass represents a different aspect of her identity that she wants to escape. The broken mirror symbolizes her desire to break free from the expectations and judgments of others, as she longs to be her true self and not conform to society's ideals.",
