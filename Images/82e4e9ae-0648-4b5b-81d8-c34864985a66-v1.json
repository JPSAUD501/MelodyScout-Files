  "lyrics": "I like digging holes and hiding things inside them\nWhen I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them\n'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night\n\nI build a home and wait for someone to tear it down\nThen pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running\n'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night\n\nAnd a thousand times I've seen this road\nA thousand times\n\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\n\nI like standing still, boy, that's just a wishful plan\nAsk me where I come from, I'll say a different land\nBut I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night\n\nI count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game\nIt's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same\nBut I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night\n\nAnd a thousand times I've seen this road\nA thousand times\n\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\n\nI like digging holes\nHiding things inside them\nWhen I grow old\nI won't forget to find them\nI like digging holes\nHiding things inside them\nWhen I grow old\nI won't forget to find them\n\nI've got no roots\n\nNo roots\n\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nI've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots\nNo!",
  "imageDescription": "A lone figure with a worn suitcase walks down an endless desert road under a star-filled night sky.  They leave behind glowing buried jars, each containing a memory. Ethereal, dreamlike, with a hint of melancholy.",
