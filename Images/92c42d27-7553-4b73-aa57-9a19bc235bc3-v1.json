  "lyrics": "Common love isn't for us\nWe created something phenomenal\nDon't you agree? Don't you agree?\nYou got me feeling diamond-rich\nNothing on this planet compares to it\nDon't you agree? Don't you agree?\n\nWho needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?\n\nAll night, I'll riot with you\nI know you got my back, and you know I got you\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)\nLet's get physical\nLights out, follow the noise\nBaby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on\nLet's get physical\n\nAdrenaline keeps on rushing in\nLove the simulation we're dreaming in\nDon't you agree? Don't you agree?\nI don't wanna live another life\n'Cause this one's pretty nice\nLiving it up\n\nWho needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?\n\nAll night, I'll riot with you\nI know you got my back, and you know I got you\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)\nLet's get physical\nLights out, follow the noise\nBaby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on\nLet's get physical\n\nHold on just a little tighter\nCome on, hold on, tell me if you're ready\nCome on (come on, come on)\nBaby, keep on dancing\nLet's get physical\n\nHold on just a little tighter\nCome on, hold on, tell me if you're ready\nCome on (come on, come on)\nBaby, keep on dancing\nLet's get physical\n\nAll night, I'll riot with you\nI know you got my back, and you know I got you\nSo come on, come on, come on\nLet's get physical\nLights out, follow the noise\nBaby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on\nLet's get physical (physical, physical)\n\nLet's get physical (physical, physical)\nPhysical (physical, physical)\nLet's get physical (physical, physical)\nCome on, phy-phy-phy-physical",
