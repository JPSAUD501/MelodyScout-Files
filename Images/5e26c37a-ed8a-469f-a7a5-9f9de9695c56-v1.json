  "imageDescription": "The image is a solitary figure sitting on the edge of a bed, surrounded by darkness. The room is dimly lit, with a few scattered pill bottles on a nightstand. The figure's head is lowered, conveying sadness and despair. The bed represents their isolation and the grave they have metaphorically dug for themselves.",
