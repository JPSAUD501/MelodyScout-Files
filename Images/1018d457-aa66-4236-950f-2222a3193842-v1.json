  "lyrics": "Down by the river by the boat\nWhere everybody goes to be alone\nWhere you won′t see any rising sun\n\nDown to the river we will run\n\nWhen by the water we drink to the dregs\nLook at the stones on the riverbed\nI can tell from your eyes\nYou've never been by the riverside\n\nDown by the water, the riverbed\nSomebody calls you, somebody says\n\"Swim with the current and float away\"\nDown by the river everyday\n\nOh my God\nI see how everything is torn in the river deep\nAnd I don′t know why I go the way\nDown by the riverside\n\nWhen that old river runs past your eyes\nTo wash off the dirt on the riverside\nGo to the water so very near\nThe river will be your eyes and ears\n\nI walk to the borders on my own\nFall in the water just like a stone\nChilled to the marrow in them bones\nWhy do I go here all alone?\n\nOh my God\nI see how everything is torn in the river deep\nAnd I don't know why I go the way\nDown by the riverside\n\nOh my God\nI see how everything is torn in the river deep\nAnd I don't know why I go the way\nDown by the riverside\n\nOh, oh, I\nOh, oh, I\nOh, oh, I\nDown by the riverside\nDown by the riverside",
  "imageDescription": "A serene and peaceful river, flowing gently under a clear blue sky. The water is crystal clear, revealing smooth stones on the riverbed. In the distance, a lone figure stands by the water, contemplating life. The image captures the tranquility and introspection portrayed in the song, \"Down by the Riverside.\"",
