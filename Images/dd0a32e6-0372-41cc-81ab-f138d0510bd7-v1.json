  "imageDescription": "A broken whiskey bottle lies shattered on a dark, deserted street. The label reads \"The Bowery.\" A streetlamp casts an eerie glow, illuminating the scattered Polaroids of memories. In the distance, a figure walks away, leaving behind the worst of their past. The image captures the contrast between the dreamy nostalgia of youth and the harsh reality of growing apart.",
