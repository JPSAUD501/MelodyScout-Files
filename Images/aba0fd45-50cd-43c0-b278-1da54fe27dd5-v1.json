  "lyrics": "Baby, can't you see I'm calling?\nA guy like you should wear a warning\nIt's dangerous, I'm falling\n\nThere's no escape, I can't wait\nI need a hit, baby, give me it\nYou're dangerous, I'm loving it\n\nToo high, can't come down\nLosing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round\nDo you feel me now?\n\nWith a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under\nWith a taste of a poison paradise\nI'm addicted to you\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\nAnd I love what you do\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nIt's getting late to give you up\nI took a sip from my devil's cup\nSlowly, it's taking over me\n\nToo high, can't come down\nIt's in the air and it's all around\nCan you feel me now?\n\nWith a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under\nWith a taste of a poison paradise\nI'm addicted to you\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\nAnd I love what you do\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nTaste of your lips, I'm on a ride\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under\nWith a taste of a poison paradise\nI'm addicted to you\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nWith a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic)\nWith a taste of a poison paradise\nI'm addicted to you\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nIntoxicate me now, with your lovin' now\nI think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now\nIntoxicate me now, with your lovin' now\nI think I'm ready now",
  "imageDescription": "A woman with vibrant, glowing eyes dances under a swirling disco ball, a euphoric smile on her face. She's surrounded by a purple haze, reaching out towards a shadowy figure with a dangerous aura. The style is dark, seductive, with elements of fantasy and a neon color palette.",
